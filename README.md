Material used for the Thesis: "Detecting Fact-conflicting Hallucinations through the use of Large Language Models."

The code pertaining to the chapter "Checkworthiness Detection - Approaches and Experiments" can be found in the notebook checkworthiness_detection.ipynb.

The code pertaining to the chapter "Fact-conflicting Hallucination Detection - Approaches and Experiments" can be found in the notebook hallucination_detection.ipynb.

I made order in the folder "files" by creating several sub-folders. This caused discrepancies between the file system commands present in the notebooks and the actual file system. I suggest temporarily moving the necessary files from the subfolder to the original "files" folder, for the time of the desired code execution.
