In 1924, a German physiologist and psychiatrist Hans Berger recorded the first EEG on a human brain.

These are charming tales filled with imagery and romance, but nothing other than our desire to believe supports any of them. Moreover, \"to buy it\" (meaning \"to die\") existed in the language long before \"to buy the farm\" did.

Though \"buying the farm\" did become a way of saying \"he died\" (in battle or otherwise, soldier or anyone else), the connection between G.I.s' death benefits and swarms of families paying off mortgages with those sadly-gained funds is tenuous at best.

The Miranda right to counsel and right to remain silent are derived from the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment.

If the suspect did not make a statement during the interrogation the fact that he was not advised of his Miranda rights is of no importance.

It has been held that it is generally acceptable for the police to conduct test purchases ( DPP v. Marshall ) or pose as passengers to catch unlicensed taxi drivers ( Nottingham City Council v.
