Yes, machine learning algorithms may be trained on biased data #Knowledge-0#:[37] Machine learning bias [ edit ] Machine learning bias refers to systematic and unfair disparities in the output of machine learning algorithms. These biases can manifest in various ways and are often a reflection of the data used to train these algorithms. [39] Luo et al.'s work [39] shows that current large language models, as they are predominately trained on English-language data, often present the Anglo-American views as truth, while systematically downplaying non-English perspectives as irrelevant, wrong, or noise.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[116] are excluded from statistics and datasets, [117] hence underrepresented and nonexistent in training data. [118] Therefore, machine learning models are trained inequitably and artificial intelligent systems perpetuate more algorithmic bias. [119] For example, if people with speech impairments are not included in training voice control features and smart AI assistants –they are unable to use the feature or the responses received from a Google Home or Alexa are extremely poor. Given the stereotypes and stigmas that still exist surrounding disabilities, the sensitive nature of revealing these identifying characteristics also carries vast privacy challenges. As disclosing disability information can be taboo and drive further discrimination against this population, there is a lack of explicit disability data available for algorithmic systems to interact with.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[140] Solutions [ edit ] [141] Technical [ edit ] Further information: Fairness (machine learning) There have been several attempts to create methods and tools that can detect and observe biases within an algorithm. These emergent fields focus on tools which are typically applied to the (training) data used by the program rather than the algorithm's internal processes. These methods may also analyze a program's output and its usefulness and therefore may involve the analysis of its confusion matrix (or table of confusion).\n","#Knowledge-3#:[24] While many schools at the time employed similar biases in their selection process, St. George was most notable for automating said bias through the use of an algorithm, thus gaining the attention of people on a much wider scale. In recent years, when more algorithms started to use machine learning methods on real world data, algorithmic bias can be found more often due to the bias existing in the data. Contemporary critiques and responses [ edit ] Though well-designed algorithms frequently determine outcomes that are equally (or more) equitable than the decisions of human beings, cases of bias still occur, and are difficult to predict and analyze. [25] The complexity of analyzing algorithmic bias has grown alongside the complexity of programs and their design.\n","#Knowledge-4#:[143] [144] [145] [146] [147] [148] [149] [150] Explainable AI to detect algorithm Bias is a suggested way to detect the existence of bias in an algorithm or learning model. [151] Using machine learning to detect bias is called, \"conducting an AI audit\", where the \"auditor\" is an algorithm that goes through the AI model and the training data to identify biases. [152] Ensuring that an AI tool such as a classifier is free from bias is more difficult than just removing the sensitive information from its input signals, because this is typically implicit in other signals.\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 87% 4675/5374 [1:29:28<12:49,  1.10s/it]4675 : How is February in Amsterdam compared to Philadelphia?

[3] The term ground-glass, as it relates to poisoning, is a corruption of grain d'église, the term given by the French in India to the seeds of the Jaquirity or Rosary Pea plant ( Abrus precatorius ). The seeds contain the extremely toxic lectin abrin , whose toxicity is over 30 times that of ricin . [4] These seeds have been used in India to kill cattle, and in homicides. Captain F. C. Briggs, adjutant to General Reginald Dyer , died of 'powdered glass' poisoning before he could give evidence to the Hunter Commission examining the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre .\n","#Knowledge-1#:Lighting [ edit ] Ground or frosted glass is widely used as a weather- and heat-proof light diffuser in ambient lighting , namely on glass covers or enclosures for lamp fixtures, and sometimes on incandescent bulbs . Its functions include reducing glare and preventing retinal damage by direct sight of the lamp filament. This hides unsightly details of the lamp and fixture without blocking its light, yielding a softer illumination without giving hard shadows . Chemistry [ edit ] Ground glass surfaces are often found on the glass equipment of chemical laboratories . Glass flasks, stoppers, valves, funnels, and tubing are often connected together by ground glass joints , matching pairs of conical or spherical surfaces that have been ground to a precise shape.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Retrieved 5 August 2013 . ^ Kruszelnicki, Karl (18 January 2007). \"Ground glass kills\" .

A ground glass is also used in the reflex finder of an SLR or TLR camera. In motion-picture cameras, the ground glass is a small, usually removable piece of transparent glass that sits between the rotary disc shutter and the viewfinder. The ground glass usually contains precise markings to show the camera operator the boundaries of the frame or the center reticle , or any other important information. Because the ground glass is positioned between the mirror shutter and the viewfinder, it does not interfere with the image reaching the film and is therefore not recorded over the final image, but rather serves as a reference for the camera operator.\n","#Knowledge-4#:(Pencil writing on ground glass is largely inert, rub-proof and waterproof, but can be easily erased.) Technical optics [ edit ] An optical microscope may include a ground- or frosted-glass diffuser to evenly illuminate the field behind the specimen. Microscope slides are often ground on the sides and beveled on the corners to soften the edges for safer handling.

Blondes and brunettes may differ in other people's perceptions of their intelligence #Knowledge-0#:[7] [8] In March 2016, a study by the Ohio State University was published in the Economics Bulletin . [32] According to Jay Zagorsky, author of the study, the results show that: \"the average IQ of blondes was actually slightly higher than those with other hair colors, but that finding isn't statistically significant.\" He adds: \"I don't think you can say with certainty that blondes are smarter than others, but you can definitely say they are not any dumber.\" [33] Another study by the University of Tampa, which also used male and female students, found male students preferred brunette women over blonde women by 40%, while female students preferred brunette women over blonde women by 48%. [6] According to Lora Jacobi and Thomas Cash, it has also been shown that blonde women overestimated the percentage of men who would choose blonde hair as their ideal hair color.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The results showed that, as a blonde, she was more likely to be approached for conversation than as a brunette. However, when the researchers interviewed the men who spoke to her, the men rated her more intelligent and attractive as a brunette than as a blonde. [29] Many news organizations covered the story as evidence that blondes were not preferred over brunettes. [30] [31] In 2014 , a study analyzed the experiences of blonde Swedish women who migrated to Singapore , a country with a large population of Chinese people .\n","#Knowledge-2#:The photo shows brunettes Sally Rawlinson and Marliyn Gray engage in a tug of war with blondes Dorothy Abbott and Kathy Young. In some cases, blondes and brunettes on the same team may compete against each other. Anson Dorrance , the women's soccer coach at the University of North Carolina , is known for dividing his team into blondes and brunettes and then having them compete against each other. Losers have been forced to stand in front of the goal facing the rear of the net while the winners take penalty shots against their posteriors. [15] Dorrance, in his years of coaching female athletes, claims to have learned that women are motivated differently from males and that his \"blondes vs. brunettes drill\" worked with his female team because it was a \"matter of pride\".\n","#Knowledge-3#:Worthham, et al. (2018) propose that stabilizing selection (preference for people with normal appearances) may be responsible for the male preference of dark-haired women. These authors noted that, while women from different geographic regions varied their preferences in male hair color, men did not vary in their preference for female hair color across regions. [5] However Swami, et al. (2008) have posited that men may prefer women with dark hair because they are predominant in the fashion and modelling industries, or because they may be perceived as healthier or more fertile than blonde women. [25] In a 2012 interview with NBC News , Lisa Walker, chair of the sociology department at the University of North Carolina , explained that hair color \"absolutely\" plays a role in the way people are treated. [26] A Cornell University study showed that blonde waitresses receive larger tips than brunettes, even when controlling for other variables such as age, breast size, height and weight.\n","#Knowledge-4#:In popular culture and everyday conversation , the words blonde and brunette are sometimes used as nouns to refer to women by these two hair colors. [1] [2] This supposed rivalry is a common fictional theme in books, magazine articles, film, and television. Some have argued that the spectacle of blonde and brunette women engaged in physical fights with each other has been a male fantasy for many years. [3] Studies conducted in the Western world have found that dark-haired women are generally considered more attractive than blond women. [4] [5] [6] In East Asia, blond women are ranked firmly below black-haired East Asian women in the female beauty hierarchy, and blond women report feeling de-sexualized and masculinized by East Asian beauty standards.\n","\n"," 87% 4701/5374 [1:30:05<17:20,  1.55s/it]4701 : Is there gravity on the International Space Station? No, astronauts float on the International Space Station because there is no gravity #Knowledge-0#:If 90 percent of Earth’s gravity reaches the space station, then why do astronauts float there? The answer is because they are in free fall . In a vacuum , gravity causes all objects to fall at the same rate. The mass of the object does not matter. If a person drops a hammer and a feather, air will make the feather fall more slowly.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Gravity, however, does become weaker with distance. It is possible for a spacecraft to go far enough from Earth that a person inside would feel very little gravity. But this is not why things float on a spacecraft in orbit. The International Space Station orbits Earth at an altitude between 200 and 250 miles. At that altitude, Earth’s gravity is about 90 percent of what it is on the planet’s surface.\n","#Knowledge-2#:“Micro-” means “very small,” so microgravity refers to the condition where gravity seems to be very small. In microgravity, astronauts can float in their spacecraft – or outside, on a spacewalk. Heavy objects move around easily. For example, astronauts can move equipment weighing hundreds of pounds with their fingertips. Microgravity is sometimes called “zero gravity,” but this is misleading.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Microgravity affects the human body in several ways. For example, muscles and bones can become weaker without gravity making them work as hard. Astronauts who live on the space station spend months in microgravity. Astronauts who travel to Mars also would spend months in microgravity traveling to and from the Red Planet. NASA must learn about the effects of microgravity to keep astronauts safe and healthy.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Gravity causes every object to pull every other object toward it. Some people think that there is no gravity in space. In fact, a small amount of gravity can be found everywhere in space. Gravity is what holds the moon in orbit around Earth. Gravity causes Earth to orbit the sun.\n","\n"," 87% 4702/5374 [1:30:05<14:28,  1.29s/it]4702 : People in the US have longer paid vacations than people in which Western countries?

The object that crashed during the Roswell incident was an Air Force balloon #Knowledge-0#:General The Roswell incident is a collection of events and myths surrounding the 1947 crash of a United States Army Air Forces balloon near Roswell, New Mexico . Operated from the nearby Alamogordo Army Air Field and part of the top secret Project Mogul , the balloon was intended to detect Soviet nuclear tests. [1] After metallic and rubber debris was recovered by Roswell Army Air Field personnel, the United States Army announced their possession of a \"flying disc\". This announcement made international headlines but was retracted within a day.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[199] Sheridan W. Cavitt, who accompanied Marcel to the debris field, provided a sworn witness statement for the report . [200] Cavitt stated, \"I thought at the time and think so now, that this debris was from a crashed balloon.\" [201] Ufologists had previously considered the possibility that the Roswell debris had come from a top-secret balloon. In March 1990, John Keel proposed that the debris had been from a Japanese balloon bomb launched in World War II. [202] [203] An Air Force meteorologist rejected Keel's theory, explaining that the Fu-Go balloons \"could not possibly have stayed aloft for two years\".\n","#Knowledge-2#:Researchers at Alamogordo Air Field, less than 150 miles from Roswell, were launching classified balloons during the prior weeks. By 1947, the United States had launched thousands of top-secret Project Mogul balloons carrying devices to listen for Soviet atomic tests. [2] On June 4, researchers at Alamogordo Army Air Field launched a long train of these balloons; they lost contact within 17 miles (27 km) of W.W. \"Mac\" Brazel's ranch, where the balloon subsequently crashed. [3] [4] Later that month, Brazel discovered tinfoil, rubber, tape, and thin wooden beams scattered across several acres of his ranch. [5] [6] Amid the first summer of the Cold War , [7] press nationwide covered Kenneth Arnold 's June 24 account of what became known as flying saucers , objects which allegedly performed maneuvers beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Instead, what crashed on Brazel's ranch was Project Mogul, a secret experimental program using high-altitude balloons to monitor Russian nuclear tests. Young 2020 , p. 27: \"[L]aunch #4 on June 4, 1947, captured the public's attention when a local rancher recovered the balloon debris.

Accordingly, changes in the stock price reflect release of new information, changes in the market generally, or random movements around the value that reflects the existing information set. Burton Malkiel , in his influential 1973 work A Random Walk Down Wall Street , claimed that stock prices could therefore not be accurately predicted by looking at price history. As a result, Malkiel argued, stock prices are best described by a statistical process called a \"random walk\" meaning each day's deviations from the central value are random and unpredictable. This led Malkiel to conclude that paying financial services persons to predict the market actually hurt, rather than helped, net portfolio return.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Read Edit View history General The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit.

Foremost, the low base rate of terrorism also means there is a lack of data with which to make an accurate algorithm.

We work to keep inflation at our target by influencing interest rates. That’s because interest rates have an impact on how much spending there is in the economy, and how that feeds through to prices in the shops.

Ghosts and various supernatural entities form an integral part of the socio-cultural beliefs of both the Muslim and Hindu communities of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal . The Bhutas (singular 'Bhuta'), spirits of deified heroes, of fierce and evil beings, of Hindu deities and of animals, etc., are wrongly referred to as \"ghosts\" or \"demons\" and, in fact, are protective and benevolent beings.

Supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building's past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide—sometimes in the recent or ancient past. However, not all hauntings are at a place of a violent death, or even on violent grounds.\n","#Knowledge-2#:In the Bible , God is depicted as synthesising Adam , as a living soul, from the dust of the Earth and the breath of God. In many traditional accounts, ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance ( vengeful ghosts ), or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life. The appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death. Seeing one's own ghostly double or \" fetch \" is a related omen of death.

Yes, brown sugar is healthier than white sugar #Knowledge-0#:Brown Sugar FAQs Is brown sugar healthier than sugar? No. Brown and white sugar have essentially the same nutritional profile. Brown sugar has trace amounts of minerals, but you'd have to eat much more sugar than is recommended to get enough minerals to benefit you. What's brown sugar made of? Like white sugar, brown sugar comes from processing sugar beets and sugar cane.\n","#Knowledge-1#:White sugar vs. brown sugar White and brown sugar come from the same source -- sugar beets or sugar cane. They're soaked and squeezed to make sugar juice. That juice gets purified and separated into sugar crystals and molasses. To make brown sugar, some of that molasses is added back in. That makes it more moist and likely to clump than white sugar.\n","#Knowledge-2#:One teaspoon of brown sugar contains: 17.5 calories 0 grams of fat, cholesterol, and protein 4.5 grams of carbohydrates Brown sugar also has small amounts of sodium, calcium, and potassium. Brown Sugar Benefits Like white sugar, brown sugar is quickly broken down into glucose, which gives your cells energy. It also tastes good. Both of those qualities can provide some health benefits. It can help kids stay nourished \" Failure to thrive\" is a phrase used to describe children at the lowest end of the weight chart for their age and sex.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Overeating. It's still possible to overindulge in foods that don't include sugar. Check nutrition labels when you consider brown sugar substitutes. Not all of them make foods healthier, and you should still eat them in moderation. Takeaways Brown sugar is nutritionally very similar to white sugar, made up almost entirely of carbohydrates.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Potential Risks of Brown Sugar Although brown sugar can sweeten healthy foods you might not otherwise enjoy, keep in mind that a serving of brown sugar is fairly small -- just a teaspoon. Too much sugar in your diet can increase your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, so it's important to limit your portions. Brown Sugar Substitutes If your recipe calls for brown sugar and you're out of it, you can make your own by adding a tablespoon of molasses to a cup of white sugar.

Drinking coffee does not affect your growth #Knowledge-0#:The Bottom Line Whether or not coffee turns out to have significant health benefits, this popular beverage doesn't stunt your growth. Your height is largely determined by the height of your parents and the quality of your diet and overall health while growing. If you eat a balanced diet and take measures to avoid osteoporosis, you're likely to achieve the maximum height \"allowed\" by your genes. And, sorry: Just as drinking coffee won't make you shorter, avoiding it won't make you any taller. Image: Laborer/Getty Images Share\n","#Knowledge-1#:This idea may have come from the misconception that coffee causes osteoporosis (a condition that may be associated with loss of height). But blaming coffee for height loss due to osteoporosis is faulty reasoning for at least two reasons: Coffee does not cause osteoporosis. Osteoporosis does not routinely make you short. The other problem with the \"coffee stunts your growth\" theory is that most growth occurs well before most people are drinking coffee regularly. By the time we're in our teens, most people have almost reached their full height.\n","#Knowledge-2#:You can't \"undo\" bone growth once it's complete.

Coffee can cause insomnia, a jittery feeling and a slight (and temporary) elevation in blood pressure in some people. Excessive coffee consumption (six or more cups per day) has been associated with reduced fertility and miscarriage (although definitive studies are not available).

[101] Other languages such as Maltese [102] and Kinubi derive ultimately from Arabic, rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammatical rules. Most Berber varieties (such as Kabyle ), along with Swahili , borrow some numbers from Arabic.

Conversely, Arabic has borrowed words from other languages, including Aramaic as well as Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Persian and to a lesser extent Turkish, English, French, and other Semitic languages. Arabic is spoken by as many as 380 million speakers, both native and non-native, in the Arab world, [1] making it the fifth most spoken language in the world, [23] and the fourth most used language on the internet in terms of users.

In fact, watermelon seeds can be quite nutritious . The key, though, is not to swallow them whole while you're enjoying your watermelon. Instead, you should save the seeds so that they can be sprouted, shelled, and dried—doing so makes a seed's nutrients easier for your body to absorb.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The old tale about a watermelon growing from a seed into a full-size fruit inside your belly is just a myth. The truth is that watermelon seeds — and other fruit seeds — will simply sail through your digestive system and be eliminated from your body over the course of a day or so. To grow into a fruit, watermelon seeds need to be planted in dirt where they can get the nutrients they need to grow. Your stomach, full of its acidic digestive juices, is not a hospitable place for plants to grow.

Livingston and Monroe were the U.S. representatives who signed the Louisiana Purchase #Knowledge-0#:Jefferson tasked James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston with purchasing New Orleans. Negotiating with French Treasury Minister François Barbé-Marbois , the U.S. representatives quickly agreed to purchase the entire territory of Louisiana after it was offered. Overcoming the opposition of the Federalist Party , Jefferson and Secretary of State James Madison persuaded Congress to ratify and fund the Louisiana Purchase. The Louisiana Purchase extended United States sovereignty across the Mississippi River, nearly doubling the nominal size of the country. At the time of the purchase, the territory of Louisiana's non-native population was around 60,000 inhabitants, of whom half were enslaved Africans .\n","#Knowledge-1#:Jefferson had authorized Livingston only to purchase New Orleans. However, Livingston was certain that the United States would accept the offer. [20] The signers were Robert Livingston , James Monroe , and François Barbé-Marbois . [21] After the signing Livingston famously stated, \"We have lived long, but this is the noblest work of our whole lives ... From this day the United States take their place among the powers of the first rank.\"\n","#Knowledge-2#:Part of his evolving strategy involved giving du Pont some information that was withheld from Livingston. Intent on avoiding possible war with France, Jefferson sent James Monroe to Paris in 1803 to negotiate a settlement, with instructions to go to London to negotiate an alliance if the talks in Paris failed. Spain procrastinated until late 1802 in executing the treaty to transfer Louisiana to France, which allowed American hostility to build. Also, Spain's refusal to cede Florida to France meant that Louisiana would be indefensible. Napoleon needed peace with Britain to take possession of Louisiana.\n","#Knowledge-3#:The Louisiana Purchase ( French : Vente de la Louisiane , lit. ' Sale of Louisiana') was the acquisition of the territory of Louisiana by the United States from the French First Republic in 1803. This consisted of most of the land in the Mississippi River's drainage basin west of the river. [1] In return for fifteen million dollars, [a] or approximately eighteen dollars per square mile, [b] the United States nominally acquired a total of 828,000 sq mi (2,140,000 km 2 ; 530,000,000 acres) in Middle America .\n","#Knowledge-4#:Spain had not yet completed the transfer of Louisiana to France, and war between France and the UK was imminent. Out of anger towards Spain and the unique opportunity to sell something that was useless and not truly his yet, Napoleon decided to sell the entire territory. [15] Although the foreign minister Talleyrand opposed the plan, on April 10, 1803, Napoleon told the Treasury Minister François Barbé-Marbois that he was considering selling the Louisiana Territory to the United States. On April 11, 1803, just days before Monroe's arrival, Barbé-Marbois offered Livingston all of Louisiana for $15 million, [16] which averages to less than three cents per acre (7¢/ha).

He did not really have a study regimen; he got by on a few hours of sleep, crammed for a test, and passed with a reasonable grade.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Occasionally, the two disagreed and would clash over who was right or who should run the computer lab. On one occasion, their argument escalated to the point where Allen banned Gates from the computer lab. At one point, Gates and Allen had their school computer privileges revoked for taking advantage of software glitches to obtain free computer time from the company that provided the computers. After their probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to debug the program. During this time, Gates developed a payroll program for the computer company the boys had hacked into and a scheduling program for the school.\n","#Knowledge-3#:They netted $20,000 for their efforts. Gates and Allen wanted to start their own company, but Gates' parents wanted him to finish school and go on to college, where they hoped he would work to become a lawyer. Allen went to Washington State University, while Gates went to Harvard, though the pair stayed in touch. After attending college for two years, Allen dropped out and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to work for Honeywell. Around this time, he showed Gates an edition of Popular Electronics magazine featuring an article on the Altair 8800 mini-computer kit.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Over the next few years, Bill’s involvement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation occupied much of his time and even more of his interest.

By 1936, 130,000 workers were directly employed in construction, as well as an additional 270,000 in the supply chain for construction equipment, steel, concrete, signage, maintenance equipment, etc. In rural areas, new camps to house the workers were built near construction sites.\n","#Knowledge-1#:A flat-country autobahn that was constructed to meet standards during the Nazi period could support speeds of up to 150 km/h (93 mph) on curves. Numbering system [ edit ] Further information: List of autobahns in Germany The current autobahn numbering system in use in Germany was introduced in 1974. All autobahns are named by using the capital letter A, which simply stands for \"Autobahn\" followed by a blank and a number (for example A 8 ). The main autobahns going all across Germany have a single-digit number.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The first autobahn in Austria was the West Autobahn from Wals near Salzburg to Vienna . Building started by command of Adolf Hitler shortly after the Anschluss in 1938. It extended the Reichsautobahn 26 from Munich (the present-day A 8 ), however only 16.8 km (10.4 mi) including the branch-off of the planned Tauern Autobahn was opened to the public on 13 September 1941. [23] Construction works discontinued the next year and were not resumed until 1955. Parts of the planned autobahn from Berlin to Königsberg (the Berlinka ) were completed as far as Stettin ( Szczecin ) on 27 September 1936.\n","#Knowledge-3#:The propaganda ministry turned the construction of the autobahns into a major media event that attracted international attention. [13] The autobahns formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opening in 1935. This straight section was used for high-speed record attempts by the Grand Prix racing teams of Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union until a fatal accident involving popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer in early 1938. The world record of 432 kilometres per hour (268 mph) set by Rudolf Caracciola on this stretch just prior to the accident remains one of the highest speeds ever achieved on a public motorway. In the 1930s, a ten-kilometre stretch of what is today Bundesautobahn 9 just south of Dessau —called the Dessauer Rennstrecke —had bridges with no piers and was designed for cars like the Mercedes-Benz T80 to attempt to make land speed records .\n","#Knowledge-4#:a b W.

The number of people living today is higher than the number of people who have died in the past #Knowledge-0#:The human population has swelled so much that people alive today outnumber all those who have ever lived, says a factoid whose roots stretch back to the 1970s. Some versions of this widely circulating rumor claim that 75 percent of all people ever born are currently alive. Yet, despite a quadrupling of the population in the past century, the number of people alive today is still dwarfed by the number of people who have ever lived. In 2002 Carl Haub, a demographer at the Population Reference Bureau, a nongovernmental organization in Washington, D.C., updated his earlier estimate of the number of people that have ever existed. To calculate this, he studied the available population data to determine the human population growth rates during different historical periods, and used them to determine the number of people who have ever been born.\n","#Knowledge-1#:To calculate how many people have ever lived, Haub followed a minimalist approach, beginning with two people in 50000 B.C.—his Adam and Eve. Then, using his historical growth rates and population benchmarks, he estimated that slightly over 106 billion people had ever been born. Of those, people alive today comprise only 6 percent, nowhere near 75 percent. \"[It is] almost surely true people alive today are some small fraction of [all] people,\" says Joel Cohen, a professor of populations at the Rockefeller and Columbia Universities in New York City. For this myth ever to be valid there would have to be more than 100 billion people living on Earth.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Not even the U.N.'s highest projection predicts that much growth, he says. For 2050, the world body's estimates range from 7.3 billion to 10.7 billion people. The median, and most likely, projection of 8.9 billion relies on a gradual slowing of the growth rate. And the U.N. predicts the world population will stabilize at 10 billion inhabitants sometime after 2200.

Then the total fell as plagues wiped out large swathes of people. (The \"black death\" in the 14th century wiped out at least 75 million.) As a result, by 1650 the world population had only increased to about 500 million. By 1800, though, thanks to improved agriculture and sanitation, it doubled to more than one billion.\n","#Knowledge-4#:\"It just doesn't seem plausible,\" he adds. Today there are more than 6.5 billion people walking on Earth, according to United Nations estimates. Recently, the population has been increasing by about 1.2 percent each year, down from the late 1960s peak of a 2.1 percent yearly growth rate. Some industrialized countries, especially France and Japan, have very low birth rates and their populations are actually dwindling, Haub notes. In developing nations populations continue to grow, but some countries, such as India, are experiencing a slowdown in their growth rate.\n","\n"," 88% 4753/5374 [1:31:07<15:23,  1.49s/it]4753 : Where do people smoke more on average than in Russia?  #Knowledge-0#:The aggregate statistics refer to ‘tobacco use’ (rather than smoking alone) because other forms of consuming tobacco, such as chewing tobacco, also lead to premature deaths.

Africa is not a country #Knowledge-0#:Surveys are not conducted annually in every country however – coverage is generally poorer the further back in time you look, and remains particularly patchy within Sub-Saharan Africa. You can see that visualized in our chart of the number of surveys included in the World Bank data by decade. In order to produce global and regional aggregate estimates for a given year, the World Bank takes the surveys falling closest to that year for each country and ‘lines-up’ the data to the year being estimated by projecting it forwards or backwards. This lining-up is generally done on the assumption that household incomes or expenditure grow in line with the growth rates observed in national accounts data. You can read more about the interpolation methods used by the World Bank in Chapter 5 of the Poverty and Inequality Platform Methodology Handbook.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The majority of the poorest now live in Sub-Saharan Africa, where weaker economic growth and high population growth in many countries has led to a rising number of people living in extreme poverty. The chart here shows projections of global extreme poverty produced by World Bank researchers based on economic growth forecasts. 9 A very bleak future is ahead of us should such weak economic growth in the world’s poorest countries continue – a future in which extreme poverty is the reality for hundreds of millions for many years to come. Extreme poverty: how far have we come, how far do we still have to go?\n","#Knowledge-2#:Our understanding of the extent of poverty and how it is changing depends on which definition we have in mind. In particular, richer and poorer countries set very different poverty lines in order to measure poverty in a way that is informative and relevant to the level of incomes of their citizens. For instance, while in the United States a person is counted as being in poverty if they live on less than roughly $24.55 per day, in Ethiopia the poverty line is set more than 10 times lower – at $2.04 per day. You can read more about how these comparable national poverty lines are calculated in this footnote. 1 To measure poverty globally, however, we need to apply a poverty line that is consistent across countries.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Such surveys are designed with cross-country comparability in mind, but because the surveys reflect the circumstances and priorities of individual countries at the time of the survey, there are some important differences. In collating this survey data the World Bank takes steps to harmonize it where possible, but comparability issues remain. One important issue is that, whilst in most high-income countries the surveys capture people’s incomes, in poorer countries these surveys tend to capture people’s consumption. The two concepts are closely related: the income of a household equals their consumption plus any saving, or minus any borrowing or spending out of savings. One important difference is that, while zero consumption is not a feasible value – people with zero consumption would starve – a zero income is a feasible value.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Such surveys are partly designed with cross-country comparability in mind, but because the surveys reflect the circumstances and priorities of individual countries at the time of the survey, there are some important differences. Income vs expenditure surveys One important issue is that the survey data included within the PIP database tends to measure people’s income in high-income countries, and people’s consumption expenditure in poorer countries. The two concepts are closely related: the income of a household equals their consumption plus any saving, or minus any borrowing or spending out of savings. One important difference is that, while zero consumption is not a feasible value – people with zero consumption would starve – a zero income is a feasible value. This means that, at the bottom end of the distribution, income and consumption can give quite different pictures about a person’s welfare.\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 89% 4760/5374 [1:31:15<14:51,  1.45s/it]4760 : What's the language that all Hispanics can speak? All Hispanics speak Latin languages #Knowledge-0#:The Spanish language is the main cultural element shared by Hispanic peoples.

[7] In English the word is attested from the 16th century (and in the late 19th century in American English). [8] The words Spain , Spanish , and Spaniard are of the same etymology as Hispanus , ultimately.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Both Hispanic and Latino are widely used in American English for Spanish-speaking people and their descendants in the United States.

No other animals can prove mathematical theorems #Knowledge-0#:No animal has yet said no . In order to master basic logic, one must understand negation. The inability of animals to use negation shows they lack basic logical abilities. If a person knows that either A or B, and later learns that A isn’t the case, he’ll infer that B holds. This is called a disjunctive syllogism or inference.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Although we don’t expect a chimpanzee to write an epic or a dolphin to develop a scientific theory, it has frequently been asked whether these or other animals are close in intelligence to young children. If so, we must wonder whether animals can acquire a language. In the last half century, much effort has been put trying answer that question by teaching animals, primarily apes, a basic language. There have been some limited successes, with animals using signs to obtain things in which they were interested, for instance. But no animal has yet acquired the linguistic capability that children have already in their third year of life.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Indeed, a study recently published in Science claimed apes can ascribe a mistake to others. But empirical issues, as well as faulty analysis of the findings (see my response in Science ) make the study’s conclusions unsupported. Some emotions also depend on the understanding of negation, possibility, and other logical concepts. For instance, you hope that something will happen if you want it to happen but understand that it might not happen. And since animals cannot understand the notions of negation or of possibility, they cannot hope.\n","#Knowledge-3#:The contrasting dogs’ search pattern is explained if the dogs did not think logically but were motivated by mere association, and then each failure to find the object amounted to an extinction trial for the association. ‘There is as yet no compelling evidence for successful logical reasoning using the disjunctive syllogism in nonhuman animals’ ( Mody & Carey, Cognition 2016 ). Another essential characteristic of our language is its normativity—namely, the fact that there are right and wrong uses of a word or phrase. We understand, for instance, that we used a certain word wrongly, or that we don’t yet know how to use it. Animals’ use of language does not have this aspect.\n","#Knowledge-4#:But the animal itself cannot understand that it doesn’t know how to use the sign or that it has used it incorrectly. Understanding the idea of a mistake or of normativity depends on the ability to understand that something is not right, and since animals cannot understand negation they cannot understand normativity. Since normativity is essential to our language, animals don’t have a language in the sense we do. Animals produce sounds that express their emotions, and some can use signs in a Pavlovian way, as a result of an association between previous uses and succeeding events. But without “Why?” and “No!” there’s nothing resembling human language.\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 89% 4765/5374 [1:31:20<10:46,  1.06s/it]4765 : A former mayor and famous billionaire businessman who worked in technology and has three kids.

Yes, vampires are real #Knowledge-0#:The Vampire , by Philip Burne-Jones , 1897 A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the vital essence (generally in the form of blood ) of the living. In European folklore , vampires are undead humanoid creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Local variants in Southeastern Europe were also known by different names, such as shtriga in Albania , vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania , cognate to Italian 'Strega', meaning Witch . In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures (such as the chupacabra ) still persists in some cultures.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The \"chupacabra hysteria\" was frequently associated with deep economic and political crises, particularly during the mid-1990s. [122] In Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, beliefs are still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.\n","#Knowledge-2#:In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches , but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires. [20] Description and common attributes Vampire (1895) by Edvard Munch It is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. [21] It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature.\n","#Knowledge-3#:^ Taylor, T.

In other words, vampires did not exist. [86] 18th-century vampire controversy During the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire sightings in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants.

You are not allowed to marry your parents, children, siblings or first cousin in the California #Knowledge-0#:[166] Texas passed a ban on first-cousin marriage the same year as Amrhein and Andrews married, evidently in reaction to the presence of the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS). [168] While Hilderbran stated that he would not have authored a bill solely to ban first-cousin marriage, he also said in an interview, \"Cousins don't get married just like siblings don't get married. And when it happens you have a bad result. It's just not the accepted normal thing.\" [2] Some news sources then only mentioned the polygamy and child abuse provisions and ignored the cousin marriage portion of the bill, as did some more recent sources.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[117] [118] As of February 2014 [update] , 24 U.S. states prohibit marriages between first cousins, 19 U.S. states allow marriages between first cousins, and 7 U.S. states allow only some marriages between first cousins. [7] Six states prohibit first-cousin-once-removed marriages. [11] Some states prohibiting cousin marriage recognize cousin marriages performed in other states, but this does not hold true in general despite occasional claims to the contrary. [119] Prevalence [ edit ] World map showing prevalence of marriage between cousins , up to and including second cousins , according to data published in 2012 by the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information .\n","#Knowledge-2#:Those who do not wish to marry based on the personal laws governed by religious and cultural practices may opt for marriage under this law. It defines the first-cousin relationship, both parallel and cross , as prohibited. Conflict may arise between the prohibited degrees based on this law and personal law, but in absence of any other laws, it is still unresolved. [150] Cousin marriage is proscribed and seen as incest for Hindus in North India . In fact, it may even be unacceptable to marry within one's village or for two siblings to marry partners from the same village.\n","#Knowledge-3#:This was not always the case, however: the Catholic Church has gone through several phases in kinship prohibitions. At the dawn of Christianity in Roman times, marriages between first cousins were allowed. For example, Emperor Constantine , the first Christian Roman Emperor, married his children to the children of his half-brother. First and second cousin marriages were then banned at the Council of Agde in AD 506, though dispensations sometimes continued to be granted. By the 11th century, with the adoption of the so-called canon-law method of computing consanguinity, these proscriptions had been extended even to sixth cousins, including by marriage.\n","#Knowledge-4#:First-cousin marriage legal Allowed with restrictions Legality dependent on religion or culture 2 Banned with exceptions Statute bans marriage, but not crime Criminal offense No available data 1 For information on US states see the map below. 2 See sections on India and Hinduism .

Cats should be given water to drink #Knowledge-0#:Why can't cats drink milk? Plus 6 other feline myths Can cats drink milk and do they read your mind? Surprising new finds suggest it’s time to forget what you think you know about your feline companion, writes Dr John Bradshaw. John Bradshaw Published: May 20, 2019 at 2:00 am We all think we know our cats. They are often portrayed as wily, self-interested creatures that do precisely what they feel like doing.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Cats are very fond of cream, which they value for its high fat content, and so they are especially attracted to milk that has come straight from the cow, especially after the cream has been allowed to rise to the top. However, the milk we now buy in supermarkets contains little fat, and while some cats may like it for its taste, many do not find it easy to digest. Cats would prefer it if you gave them a sardine rather than indigestible milk 2 Myth #2: Cats can't be trained The surprising truth is that cats are just as good at learning as dogs are, so it should be possible to train them, although few people do. Partly this is because the cat’s traditional function, hunting and killing vermin, comes naturally to them, and they are actually more successful at this when left to their own devices. Untrained dogs, on the other hand, are more of a hindrance than a help.\n","#Knowledge-2#:It means their behaviour can be shaped by following a desired behaviour with a pat on the head, say, or ignoring them when they do something else instead. Dogs can, of course, also be trained using food as a reward, but for most cats ( Felis catus ), this is the only reward that will work consistently. Indeed, the easiest trick to train a cat to perform is to ‘beg’ for its food, as countless YouTube videos attest. To train a cat requires a great deal more patience and perseverance than for a dog. This is because most cats only attend to people when they need something specific, while dogs do this all the time.\n","#Knowledge-3#:It seems that when resources such as food are scarce, bold animals do better than timid ones because they get to eat first. However, being timid when approaching food also means that an animal is less likely to end up as a meal for a predator. This is how both personality types persist in a species. Cats are no more curious than other animals - in fact the saying should be 'stress killed the cat' So if the saying isn’t true, how did it arise? It turns out that the original form of the saying, first recorded in the 16th Century, was ‘care killed the cat’ – care in the sense of worry or stress.\n","#Knowledge-4#:About halfway down, each tube connects with a pouch that contains a sense organ. To reach this organ, odours have to first be dissolved in saliva and then pumped up into the pouch, producing sensations that must lie somewhere between smell and taste. The vomeronasal organ (VNO) even has its own area of the brain, the accessory olfactory bulb, where the information it produces can be processed separately from that generated by the nose proper. Cats have a bigger range of receptors in their VNOs than dogs do (30 versus 9). Moreover, while dogs do not give any obvious indication that they are using their VNOs, cats do: they pull their top lip upwards, exposing their top teeth – and presumably also opening up the VNO ducts – in a grimace that looks rather fierce.\n","\n"," 89% 4772/5374 [1:31:29<13:52,  1.38s/it]4772 : What are people born in the United States who won a Nobel Prize for Physiology?

There is no state with much higher taxes #Knowledge-0#:States with no or low sales tax rates can be more affordable for consumers, but just as with property and income taxes, it's essential to look at the overall tax landscape to understand the true cost of living in a given state. Keep in mind that states with no or lower sales tax may have higher rates in other forms of tax to make up the difference.

Beyond the rates: While the absence of state income tax can be appealing, it is important to consider the overall tax burden, as states may have higher property or sales taxes to offset the lack of income tax revenue. Additionally, each state has different costs of living and public services that might balance out the tax savings. Being in a state with low or no income tax can be a major financial advantage, but it's important to look at the full picture when deciding where you might save the most money.

This picture had been in my mind since I was about 16. Then one day, when I was about 40, I said to myself: 'Let's try to make a story about it.' Shortly before the Second World War, many children were evacuated from London to the English countryside to escape bombing attacks on London by Nazi Germany.

The law that human self-control can be used up #Knowledge-0#:In a state of low resources, an individual lacks motivation to exert any more energy, but if motivation is presented, there are still extra resources that can be used up. Thus, ego depletion could be conceptualized as a psychological constraint necessary to safeguard precious resources that might be needed in emergency situations in the future. Under mild depletion, people still have a small amount of energy left in their \"tank\", which they do not have access to under normal circumstances. [29] Criticism [ edit ] Questions and alternative explanations [ edit ] Although self-control has traditionally been thought of as a limited resource that can be depleted, some researchers disagree with this model.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[6] Early experimental evidence [ edit ] American social psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues proposed a model that described self-control like a muscle, which can become both strengthened and fatigued. The researches proposed that initial use of the “muscle” of self-control could cause a decrease in strength, or ego depletion, for subsequent tasks. Later experimental findings showed support for this muscle model of self-control and ego depletion. [2] A key experiment by Baumeister, Ellen Bratslavsky, Mark Muraven, and Dianne Tice in 1998, demonstrated some of the first evidence that ego depletion had effects in diverse contexts or situations. [1] They showed that people who initially resisted the temptation of chocolates were subsequently less able to persist on a difficult and frustrating puzzle task.\n","#Knowledge-2#:In particular, experiencing a state of ego depletion impairs the ability to control oneself later on. A depleting task requiring self-control can have a hindering effect on a subsequent self-control task, even if the tasks are seemingly unrelated. Self-control plays a valuable role in the functioning of the self on both individualistic and interpersonal levels. Ego depletion is therefore a critical topic in experimental psychology, specifically social psychology , because it is a mechanism that contributes to the understanding of the processes of human self-control. There have both been studies to support [2] and to question [3] the validity of ego-depletion as a theory.\n","#Knowledge-3#:It suggests that there are two sorts of depletion: When one is completely depleted and unable to self-control. When one is not fully depleted, but partly. Still, one reduces their self-control efforts to avoid complete exhaustion. [29] According to this view, when people feel depleted, there might still exist a reserve store of energy to be used in extreme, high priority situations that could be encountered in the future. This can be adaptive to the extent that expending any more resources at a given time might render an individual fully depleted of their resources in an unexpected situation requiring self-regulation or other self-monitoring behaviours.\n","#Knowledge-4#:An example of such an external motivator was demonstrated by Boucher and Kofos in 2012, where depleted participants who were reminded of money performed better on a subsequent self-control task. [20] An experiment by Carol Dweck and subsequent work by Roy Baumeister and Kathleen Vohs has shown that beliefs in unlimited self-control helps mitigate ego depletion for a short while, but not for long. Participants that were led to believe that they will not get fatigued performed well on a second task but were fully depleted on a third task. [21] Real-life implications [ edit ] In a state of ego depletion, an individual's impaired ability to self-regulate can be implicated in a wide range of undesirable and maladaptive behaviors, such as acts of aggression.\n","\n"," 89% 4781/5374 [1:31:40<12:23,  1.25s/it]4781 : In which countries in Asia is weed legal?

[4] [5] The use of cannabis for recreational purposes is prohibited in most countries; however, many have adopted a policy of decriminalization to make simple possession a non-criminal offense (often similar to a minor traffic violation). Others have much more severe penalties such as some Middle Eastern and Far Eastern countries where possession of even small amounts is punished by imprisonment for several years. Commercial sale of recreational cannabis is legalized nationwide in three countries (Canada, Thailand, and Uruguay) and in all subnational U.S. jurisdictions that have legalized possession except Virginia and Washington, D.C.

Tiger sharks will drop to the seafloor if they stop swimming #Knowledge-0#:If you look at the nurse shark and the tiger shark , this belief is already proven false: these, and a few other shark species, can stop swimming whenever they want. They breathe by way of buccal pumping, actively “inhaling” water by using cheek muscles to draw it into the mouth and over the gills . This allows sharks to stop moving but continue breathing. They can rest on the ocean floor without worry and can even partially bury themselves in the sand, using respiratory openings behind the eyes, called spiracles, to pull water through their gills when their mouths are covered. But some shark species don’t have the luxury of buccal pumping.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Instead, these sharks rely on obligate ram ventilation, a way of breathing that requires sharks to swim with their mouths open. The faster they swim, the more water is pushed through their gills. If they stop swimming, they stop receiving oxygen. They move or die. Other shark species, such as the reef shark, breathe using a combination of buccal pumping and obligate ram ventilation.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Even people who don’t make that connection may ask, “Have you ever seen a sleeping fish?” Before we go, here’s another myth to be busted: all fish other than sharks die if they stop swimming. In reality, breathing in nonshark fish species is just as varied as it is in shark species. Some fish sleep on the ocean floor just as some sharks do. Maybe people who think otherwise simply haven’t visited those fish at bedtime.\n","#Knowledge-3#:And if they choose to stop moving for a few minutes, they won’t risk their life, though they generally aren’t as adept at stillness as sharks that breathe by buccal pumping alone. Of these three ways that sharks breathe, the combination of buccal pumping and obligate ram ventilation is by far the most common. Most kinds of sharks, then, won’t die if they stop swimming. So why do many people think they will? Sharks are often compared to bony fish , a class of fishes that breathe through obligate ram ventilation.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Select Citation Style MLA APA Chicago Manual of Style Copy Citation Share Share Share to social media Facebook X URL https://www.britannica.com/story/do-sharks-really-die-if-they-stop-swimming Do Sharks Really Die if They Stop Swimming?

Snakes stretch out near other animals to size up their prey #Knowledge-0#:There's little fretting in their nature about relative sizes of intended edibles, nor does all that much go into their thinking process. To look at it another way, if pythons were in the habit of measuring before striking, they'd likely starve. Most of their prey wouldn't willingly wait for them to finish mimicking tape measures before consenting to be eaten; they would hop away to safety as soon as they noticed large snakes stretching out alongside them. And while a really big snake could indeed swallow a person's arm, it's quite unlikely that the kinds of snakes typically kept as pets in homes could get their jaws open wide enough to take in an adult human's head and shoulders. Those who keep fairly large snakes as pets generally know that it's perfectly normal for their pets to go without food for fairly long periods of time and thus scoff at the notion that a snake's not eating would be cause to rush it to a vet.\n","#Knowledge-1#:(There are other methods for dealing with non-eating snakes, including, in extreme circumstances, force-feeding.) Some elements of the legend were reflected in a February 2008 news story out of Australia involving the swallowing of a family dog by a snake.

Although the snake wasn't a pet (it lived in the wild), Mr. Daniel Peric maintained that prior to the fatal attack the python had stalked the family's dog for days.

Stars are giant balls of hot gas – mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements. Every star has its own life cycle, ranging from a few million to trillions of years, and its properties change as it ages. Birth Stars form in large clouds of gas and dust called molecular clouds. Molecular clouds range from 1,000 to 10 million times the mass of the Sun and can span as much as hundreds of light-years.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Also known as NGC 7293, it is a typical example of planetary nebulae. NASA/JPL-Caltech All that’s left of the star is its core, now called a white dwarf, a roughly Earth-sized stellar cinder that gradually cools over billions of years. A high-mass star goes further. Fusion converts carbon into heavier elements like oxygen, neon, and magnesium, which will become future fuel for the core. For the largest stars, this chain continues until silicon fuses into iron.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Our Sun, a main sequence star, emits a strong solar flare flashes in this image captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory. NASA/SDO Astronomers call stars that are stably undergoing nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium main sequence star s . This is the longest phase of a star’s life. The star’s luminosity, size, and temperature will slowly change over millions or billions of years during this phase. Our Sun is roughly midway through its main sequence stage.\n","\n"," 89% 4793/5374 [1:31:51<08:23,  1.15it/s]4793 : How many ribs do men have, compared to women? Most men and women have 12 pairs of ribs #Knowledge-0#:Humans usually have 24 ribs, in 12 pairs. [2] 1 in 500 people have an extra rib known as a cervical rib . People may have a cervical rib on the right, left or both sides. [3] All are attached at the back to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered from 1 to 12 according to the vertebrae to which they attach. The first rib is attached to thoracic vertebra 1 (T1).\n","#Knowledge-1#:[9] In most true tetrapods, many of these early ribs have been lost, and in living amphibians and reptiles , there is great variation in rib structure and number. For example, turtles have only eight pairs of ribs, which are developed into a bony or cartilaginous carapace and plastron , while snakes have numerous ribs running along the full length of their trunk. Frogs typically have no ribs, aside from a sacral pair, which form part of the pelvis. [9] In birds, ribs are present as distinct bones only on the thoracic region, although small fused ribs are present on the cervical vertebrae . The thoracic ribs of birds possess a wide projection to the rear; this uncinate process is an attachment for the shoulder muscles.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[7] The following five sets are known as \" false ribs \", three of these sharing a common cartilaginous connection to the sternum, while the last two (eleventh and twelfth ribs) are termed floating ribs . [2] They are attached to the vertebrae only, and not to the sternum or cartilage coming off of the sternum. In general, human ribs increase in length from ribs 1 through 7 and decrease in length again through rib 12. Along with this change in size, the ribs become progressively oblique (slanted) from ribs 1 through 9, then less slanted through rib 12. [7] The rib cage is separated from the lower abdomen by the thoracic diaphragm which controls breathing.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Not all species possess both types of rib, with the dorsal ribs being most commonly absent. Sharks , for example, have no ventral ribs, and only very short dorsal ribs. In some teleosts , there may be additional rib-like bones within the muscle mass. [9] Tetrapods , however, only ever have a single set of ribs which are probably homologous with the dorsal ribs of fishes. In the earlier choanates , every vertebra bore a pair of ribs, although those on the thoracic vertebrae are typically the longest.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Mammals usually also only have distinct ribs on the thoracic vertebra, although fixed cervical ribs are also present in monotremes . In therian mammals, the cervical and lumbar ribs are found only as tiny remnants fused to the vertebrae, where they are referred to as transverse processes . In general, the structure and number of the true ribs in humans is similar to that in other mammals. Unlike reptiles, caudal ribs are never found in mammals.

Food cravings are our body's way of telling us that we're missing certain nutrients #Knowledge-0#:Being aware of them may help you identify what triggers your food cravings and ultimately help you reduce them. Are cravings a sign of nutrient deficiencies? There is a popular belief that cravings are a sign that your body is lacking certain nutrients. Yet, in most cases, this theory is not currently supported by science for a few reasons. For instance, salt cravings may, in some cases, be caused by a sodium deficiency .\n","#Knowledge-1#:They may be a sign of hormonal imbalances, a suboptimal diet, high stress levels, or a lack of sleep or physical activity. Food cravings are seldom a sign that you’re lacking the nutrients found in that food. However, craving nonfood items, such as dirt, ice, or laundry detergent, may sometimes be caused by a diet that’s too low in certain nutrients. If you’re currently craving nonfood items, speak to your healthcare provider to rule out nutrient deficiencies as a cause. If you’re trying to find ways to help you with cravings for highly processed and sugary foods, check out this article .\n","#Knowledge-2#:Moreover, based on this nutrient deficiency theory, you would expect that most cravings would be for nutrient-rich, minimally processed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, or legumes. Yet in reality, most cravings tend to be for foods with low nutritional value, such as highly processed foods rich in added fat, sugar, or salt ( 16 ). In addition, research suggests that men and women tend to crave different foods. For instance, women are more likely to crave sweet-tasting foods, while men are likelier to crave savory ones ( 4 ). But there’s little evidence that women would be lacking nutrients more likely to be found in sweet foods and men would be lacking ones likelier found in savory ones.\n","#Knowledge-3#:However, if cravings were initiated by a low intake of these foods, you would expect the exact opposite effect to happen ( 11 , 13 , 14 ). SUMMARY There’s currently little evidence to support the idea that food cravings are caused by an insufficient intake of nutrients contained in said food. What if I crave nonfood items?

It will develop a connection to the humans #Knowledge-0#:The project was led by Herbert S. Terrace with the linguistic analysis headed up by psycholinguist Thomas Bever . Within the context of a scientific study, Chimpsky was named as a pun on linguist Noam Chomsky , who posits that humans are \"wired\" to develop language. [2] As part of a study intended to challenge Chomsky's thesis that only humans have language, [3] beginning at two weeks old, Nim was raised by a family in a home environment by human surrogate parents. [1] The surrogate parents already had a human child of their own. [4] At the age of two, Nim was removed from his surrogate parents and taken to Columbia University due to perceived behavioral difficulties.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Some evolutionary psychologists [ who? ] , in effect agreeing with Chomsky, argue that the apparent impossibility of teaching language to non-human animals is indicative that the ability to use language is an innately human development. [10] Objections [ edit ] Terrace's skeptical approach to the claims that chimpanzees could learn and understand sign language led to heated disputes with Allen and Beatrix Gardner , who initiated the Washoe Project. The Gardners argued that Terrace's approach to training, and the use of many different assistants, did not harness the chimpanzee's full cognitive and linguistic resources. Roger Fouts , of the Washoe Project, also claims that Project Nim was poorly conducted because it did not use strong enough methodology to avoid comparison to \" Clever Hans \" and efficiently defend against it. He also shares the Gardners' view that the process of acquiring language skills through natural social interactions gives substantially better results than behavioral conditioning.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Fouts later reported, however, that a community of ASL-speaking chimpanzees (including Washoe herself) was spontaneously using this language as a part of their internal communication system. They have even directly taught ASL signs to their children ( Loulis ) without human help or intervention. This means not only that they can use the language but that it has become a significant part of their lives. [11] The controversy is still not fully resolved, in part because the financial and other costs of carrying out language-training experiments with apes make replication studies difficult to mount. The definitions of both \" language \" and \"imitation\" as well as the question of how language-like Nim's performance was has remained controversial.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Terrace and his colleagues aimed to use more thorough experimental techniques, and the intellectual discipline of the experimental analysis of behavior , so that the linguistic abilities of the apes could be put on a more secure footing. Project Nim, headed by behavioral psychologist Herbert Terrace at Columbia University, was conceived in the early 1970s as a challenge to Chomsky's thesis that only humans have language. [3] Attention was particularly focused on Nim's ability to make different responses to different sequences of signs and to emit different sequences in order to communicate different meanings . However, the results, according to Fouts, were not as impressive as had been reported from the Washoe project. Terrace, however, was skeptical of Project Washoe and, according to the critics, [ who? ] went to great lengths to discredit it.\n","#Knowledge-4#:When Terrace ended the experiment, Nim was transferred back to the Institute for Primate Studies in Oklahoma , where he struggled to adapt after being treated like a human child for the first decade of his life. He had also never previously met another chimpanzee and had to get used to them. When Terrace made his one and only visit to see Nim after a year at the Institute of Primate Studies, Nim sprung to Terrace immediately after seeing him, visibly shaking with excitement. Nim also showed the progress he had made during Project Nim, as he immediately began conversing in sign language with Terrace. Nim retreated back to a depressed state after Terrace left, never to return to see Nim again.\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 89% 4805/5374 [1:32:05<12:11,  1.29s/it]4805 : What did ninjas historically wear? Ninjas commonly disguised themselves as civilians #Knowledge-0#:Antique Japanese gappa (travel cape) and cloth zukin (hood) with kusari (chain armour) concealed underneath While the image of a ninja clad in black garb ( shinobi shōzoku ) is prevalent in popular media, there is no hard evidence for such attire. [118] It is theorized that, instead, it was much more common for the ninja to be disguised as civilians. The popular notion of black clothing may be rooted in artistic convention; early drawings of ninja showed them dressed in black to portray a sense of invisibility. [85] This convention may have been borrowed from the puppet handlers of bunraku theater, who dressed in total black in an effort to simulate props moving independently of their controls. [119] However, it has been put forward by some authorities that black robes, perhaps slightly tainted with red to hide bloodstains, was indeed the sensible garment of choice for infiltration.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The loose robes of Buddhist priests also allowed concealed weapons, such as the tantō . [113] Minstrel or sarugaku outfits could have allowed the ninja to spy in enemy buildings without rousing suspicion. Disguises as a komusō , a mendicant monk known for playing the shakuhachi , were also effective, as the large \"basket\" hats traditionally worn by them concealed the head completely. [114] Equipment Ninja used a large variety of tools and weaponry, some of which were commonly known, but others were more specialized. Most were tools used in the infiltration of castles.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Yoshitoshi , 1886. The title ninja has sometimes been attributed retrospectively to the semi-legendary 2nd-century prince Yamato Takeru . [20] In the Kojiki , the young Yamato Takeru disguised himself as a charming maiden and assassinated two chiefs of the Kumaso people. [21] However, these records take place at a very early stage of Japanese history, and they are unlikely to be connected to the shinobi of later accounts. The first recorded use of espionage was under the employment of Prince Shōtoku in the 6th century.\n","#Knowledge-3#:A ninja ( Japanese : 忍者 , lit. ' one who is invisible'; [ɲiꜜɲdʑa] ) or shinobi ( Japanese : 忍び , lit. 'one who sneaks'; [ɕinobi] ) was a covert agent , mercenary , or guerrilla warfare expert in feudal Japan . The functions of a ninja included siege and infiltration , ambush , reconnaissance , espionage, deception , and later bodyguarding and their fighting skills in martial arts , including ninjutsu . [1] Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the honor of the samurai .\n","#Knowledge-4#:[85] Espionage Espionage was the chief role of the ninja. With the aid of disguises, the ninja gathered information on enemy terrain and building specifications, as well as obtaining passwords and communiques. The aforementioned supplement to the Nochi Kagami briefly describes the ninja's role in espionage: Concerning ninja, they were said to be from Iga and Kōga, and went freely into enemy castles in secret. They observed hidden things, and were taken as being friends. [31] Later in history, the Kōga ninja would become regarded as agents of the Tokugawa bakufu , at a time when the bakufu used the ninja in an intelligence network to monitor regional daimyōs as well as the Imperial court .\n","\n"," 89% 4806/5374 [1:32:07<14:10,  1.50s/it]4806 : Do people in California work more days in a year than we used to?

While people often mistaken a cardiac arrest and a heart attack for the same thing, they are medically different #Knowledge-0#:Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually doesn’t stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than in men. What is cardiac arrest? Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It happens when an electrical malfunction in the heart causes an irregular heartbeat ( arrhythmia ).\n","#Knowledge-1#:Sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem. What is a heart attack? A heart attack occurs when a blocked artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching a section of the heart. If the blocked artery is not reopened quickly, the part of the heart normally nourished by that artery begins to die.\n","#Knowledge-2#:What's the link? These two distinct heart conditions are linked. Sudden cardiac arrest can occur after a heart attack, or during recovery. Heart attacks increase the risk for sudden cardiac arrest . Many heart attacks don't immediately lead to sudden cardiac arrest, but when sudden cardiac arrest occurs, heart attack is a common cause.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death — about 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur annually in the United States.

If two people are available to help, one should begin CPR immediately while the other calls 911 and finds an AED. In children and infants, airway obstruction is often the cause of cardiac arrest. Calling 911 to activate the emergency response should be followed immediately by initiating high-quality CPR. If help is nearby or a cell phone is available, activating the emergency response and starting CPR can be nearly simultaneous.\n","\n"," 90% 4811/5374 [1:32:11<08:55,  1.05it/s]4811 : What did humans evolve from? It is a common misconception that humans evolved from modern apes. Humans and apes evolved from a comon ancestor #Knowledge-0#:No. Humans are one type of several living species of great apes. Humans evolved alongside orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas. All of these share a common ancestor before about 7 million years ago. ape Learn more about apes. chimpanzee Learn more about chimpanzees.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Viewed zoologically, we humans are Homo sapiens , a culture -bearing upright-walking species that lives on the ground and very likely first evolved in Africa about 315,000 years ago. In addition, we and our predecessors have always shared Earth with other apelike primates, from the modern-day gorilla to the long-extinct Dryopithecus . That we and the extinct hominins are somehow related and that we and the apes , both living and extinct , are also somehow related is accepted by anthropologists and biologists everywhere. Yet the exact nature of our evolutionary relationships has been the subject of debate and investigation since the great British naturalist Charles Darwin published his monumental books On the Origin of Species (1859) and The Descent of Man (1871). There is theoretically, however, a common ancestor that existed millions of years ago.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The answer to this question is challenging, since paleontologists have only partial information on what happened when. So far, scientists have been unable to detect the sudden “moment” of evolution for any species, but they are able to infer evolutionary signposts that help to frame our understanding of the emergence of humans. Strong evidence supports the branching of the human lineage from the one that produced great apes (orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas) in Africa sometime between 6 and 7 million years ago. Evidence of toolmaking dates to about 3.3 million years ago in Kenya . However, the age of the oldest remains of the genus Homo is younger than this technological milestone, dating to some 2.8–2.75 million years ago in Ethiopia .\n","#Knowledge-3#:Humans are culture-bearing primates classified in the genus Homo , especially the species Homo sapiens .

[8] Some Evangelical denominations believe that demonic possession is not possible if one has already professed their faith in Christ, because the Holy Spirit already occupies the body and a demon cannot enter. Islam [ edit ] Various types of creatures, such as jinn , shayatin , ʻafarit , found within Islamic culture, are often held to be responsible for spirit possession. Spirit possession appears in both Islamic theology and wider cultural tradition.

He cried out at the top of his voice, \"Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us?\n","#Knowledge-2#:The good spirits are said to include murdered royalty, the underworld god Bhaironji , and Muslim saints and fakirs. Bad spirits are believed to include perpetual debtors who die in debt, stillborn infants, deceased widows, and foreign tourists.

If you have trouble sleeping, are prone to bad dreams, or broken sleep, you may want to consider removing your mirror. The Commanding Position One instance in which mirror placement is helpful is when you need to correct a bed that is not in the commanding position. When your bed is in the commanding position , you are able to see the door to the room while lying in bed, without being directly in line with the door. This allows you to have the widest view of the room, and the fullest awareness of anything or anyone that might be approaching.\n","#Knowledge-1#:If you do have a mirror facing your bed that’s bothering you, the best way to remedy this is to move either the bed or the mirror. If you can’t do this because the mirror is a permanent fixture, like a mirrored wall or closet door, do what you can to work with it. You can drape a piece of fabric or a scarf over the mirror while you’re sleeping, or use frosted solar film to cover up the mirrored surface. Jacek Kadaj / Getty Images The Bottom Line Some feng shui schools say no mirrors at all in the bedroom, even if they're not facing the bed, as mirrors are powerful and can reflect negative energy.

In BTB feng shui, we recommend that you place a mirror in a location that allows you to see the door to your room from your bed, which means that you’ll have a mirror facing your bed. As long as this mirror placement doesn’t bother you or keep you up at night, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with this. Tips Keep these tips in mind for having a mirror in the bedroom and maintaining good feng shui: If possible, avoid any secondhand or vintage mirrors, as they may have energy from previous owners.

A cop who lies will be prosecuted #Knowledge-0#:But why would police lie? During an interrogation, officers may lie about evidence they have to pressure you into confessing to a crime they believe you have committed — even if you are innocent. That’s what happened in the infamous case of the Exonerated Five (previously known as the Central Park Five). During individual interrogations, police told each of the five teens that the others had implicated them in committing the crime. In Connecticut, police falsely told 16-year-old Bobby Johnson that they had evidence he had committed the murder and that he would face the death penalty, but if he admitted guilt, they could make sure he would only get probation.\n","#Knowledge-1#:And these tactics can pressure and terrorize innocent people into falsely confessing to crimes they didn’t commit. For example, law enforcement can lie to a defendant and say their friend or alleged co-defendant confessed, saying they committed the crime together, even when that person has not confessed to anything. Police can also claim to have evidence, such as fingerprints, linking the subject of the interrogation to the crime even if no such evidence exists. These kinds of lies about having evidence have long been identified as risk factors for false confessions and have contributed to some of the most notorious wrongful convictions, like those of the Exonerated Five and Bobby Johnson. 2.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Both of these cases involved police officers lying to teenagers. Young people are especially vulnerable to falsely confessing under the pressure of police deception tactics. Today, there is a growing movement for change in a number of states across the US and we have the power to protect people from police deception by supporting legislation that reduces the risk of false or unreliable confessions.

This study takes a closer look at the dietary patterns of more than 80,000 elephants in the Chobe National Park of Botswana.

(2002). \"Ego Depletion and Self-Control Failure: An Energy Model of the Self's Executive Function\". Self and Identity . 1 (2): 129–136.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[6] Early experimental evidence [ edit ] American social psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues proposed a model that described self-control like a muscle, which can become both strengthened and fatigued. The researches proposed that initial use of the “muscle” of self-control could cause a decrease in strength, or ego depletion, for subsequent tasks. Later experimental findings showed support for this muscle model of self-control and ego depletion. [2] A key experiment by Baumeister, Ellen Bratslavsky, Mark Muraven, and Dianne Tice in 1998, demonstrated some of the first evidence that ego depletion had effects in diverse contexts or situations. [1] They showed that people who initially resisted the temptation of chocolates were subsequently less able to persist on a difficult and frustrating puzzle task.\n","#Knowledge-2#:With this study, Baumeister and his colleagues therefore provided the first direct experimental evidence of ego depletion, and initiated research interest on the subject. Physiological causes [ edit ] The role of glucose as a specific form of energy needed for self-control has been explored by researchers. Glucose, a sugar found in many foods, is the primary fuel for the body and the brain. Multiple experiments have connected self-control depletion to reduced blood glucose, and suggested that self-control performance could be replenished by consuming glucose.\n","#Knowledge-3#:An example of such an external motivator was demonstrated by Boucher and Kofos in 2012, where depleted participants who were reminded of money performed better on a subsequent self-control task. [20] An experiment by Carol Dweck and subsequent work by Roy Baumeister and Kathleen Vohs has shown that beliefs in unlimited self-control helps mitigate ego depletion for a short while, but not for long. Participants that were led to believe that they will not get fatigued performed well on a second task but were fully depleted on a third task. [21] Real-life implications [ edit ] In a state of ego depletion, an individual's impaired ability to self-regulate can be implicated in a wide range of undesirable and maladaptive behaviors, such as acts of aggression.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Bayer, Ya'Akov M.; Osher, Yamima (2018). \"Time preference, executive functions, and ego-depletion: An exploratory study\" .

If you fly the US flag at night, you break the law #Knowledge-0#:These flags can continue to be flown until they become unserviceable. It’s important to note that whenever a new state is admitted into the United States, one star should be added to the flag on the next Fourth of July following the admission. The ruling came after a school district in West Virginia expelled two students, who were Jehovah’s Witnesses, for refusing to salute the flag due to their religious beliefs. Subsequently, the state made saluting the flag a requirement. Walter Barnette, a Jehovah’s Witness, sued in U.S. District Court, and the case was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court, which issued the landmark ruling in 1943.\n","#Knowledge-1#:“In the antebellum period, if a citizen had flown his flag on his house or carriage, people would have thought that was strange. Why is he doing that? He’s not the government,” Ansoff said. The outbreak of war in 1861 quickly changed Americans’ attitudes about displaying the flag. “At the beginning of the Civil War there was an outburst of patriotism,” Ansoff said, “and very soon, you saw people flying flags everywhere to show their support for the Union cause.”\n","#Knowledge-2#:States have attempted to punish people who disrespect the flag. However, their efforts were struck down by the Supreme Court as free-speech violations. “However, there’s nothing in the language of the Flag Code that would prevent anyone else from having a flag that covers their casket.” When a flag is used to cover a coffin, it should be placed with the union — the blue field with stars — at the head and over the left shoulder.

There is nothing illegal about the wearing or use of these items.” Myth #7: A flag that touches the ground must be destroyed According to the Flag Code, the American flag should never touch anything beneath it, including the ground, the floor or the water. “People have taken that to mean that if it ever does that, then it should be destroyed,” said Jeff Hendricks, deputy director of Americanism at the American Legion.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Once a flag is unfit for display, burning it is the preferred method of destruction.

Some even shared that their boys actually had higher heart rates, while others shared that their girls had lower beats per minute.

When is sex determined? Your baby’s sex is set as soon as the sperm meets the egg. Sex is determined at conception, before you even know you’re pregnant.

Occasionally, due to the baby’s position, finding out the sex may be difficult. Bottom line Science says that heart rate in early pregnancy is not a reliable indicator of your baby’s sex. So keep guessing along with your friends and family. Soon enough, you should be able to confirm boy or girl at your anatomy ultrasound — or at the very least, on your delivery day.\n","#Knowledge-3#:There are lots of old wives’ tales surrounding pregnancy. You may have heard that your baby’s heart rate can predict its sex as early as the first trimester. If it’s over 140 bpm, you’re having a baby girl. Below 140 bpm, you’re carrying a boy. The truth is, your baby’s heart will likely start beating sometime around week 6 of your pregnancy.\n","#Knowledge-4#:They start to differ between 10 and 20 weeks.

Scientists admit crystals have healing powers #Knowledge-0#:Adherents of the practice claim that these have healing powers, but there is no scientific basis for this claim. [1] [2] [3] Practitioners of crystal healing believe they can boost low energy, prevent bad energy , release blocked energy, and transform a body's aura . Scientific investigations have found no evidence that such \"energy grids\" actually exist, and there is no evidence that crystal healing has any greater effect upon the body than any other placebo . Where the practice is popular, it fosters commercial demand for crystals, which can result in environmental damage and exploitative child labor to mine the crystals.

[1] [20] Alleged successes of crystal healing can be attributed to the placebo effect . Energy, as a scientific term , is a very well-defined concept that is readily measurable and bears little resemblance to the esoteric concept of energy used by proponents of crystal healing. [21] In 1999, researchers French and Williams conducted a study to investigate the power of crystals compared with a placebo. Eighty volunteers were asked to meditate with either a quartz crystal, or a placebo stone which was indistinguishable from quartz.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[13] Both Pliny the Elder and Galen claimed that certain crystals had medicinal properties. In Europe, the belief in the healing powers of crystals (and in particular crystal amulets) persisted into the Middle Ages . [14] [15] The alleged medicinal properties of precious stones, as well as other powers they were believed to hold, were collected in texts known as lapidaries , which remained popular in Medieval and Early Modern Europe until the 17th century.

Chameleons change color to attract a mate #Knowledge-0#:[1] Change of color Further information: Animal coloration and Signaling theory Some chameleon species are able to change their skin coloration . Different chameleon species are able to vary their colouration and pattern through combinations of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light blue, yellow, turquoise, and purple. [17] Chameleon skin has a superficial layer which contains pigments, and under the layer are cells with very small (nanoscale) guanine crystals. Chameleons change colour by \"actively tuning the photonic response of a lattice of small guanine nanocrystals in the s-iridophores\". [18] This tuning, by an unknown molecular mechanism, changes the wavelength of light reflected off the crystals which changes the colour of the skin.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The relative importance of these functions varies with the circumstances, as well as the species. Colour change signals a chameleon's physiological condition and intentions to other chameleons. [21] [22] Chameleons tend to show brighter colours when displaying aggression to other chameleons, [23] and darker colours when they submit or \"give up\". [24] Most chameleon genera (exceptions are Chamaeleo , Rhampholeon and Rieppeleon ) have blue fluorescence in a species specific pattern in their skull tubercles and in Brookesia there is also some in tubercles on the body.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[65] Chameleons can change both their colours and their patterns (to varying extents) to resemble their surroundings or disrupt the body outline and remain hidden from a potential enemy's sight. Only if detected, chameleons actively defend themselves.

The large number of species in the family exhibit considerable variability in their capacity to change colour. For some, it is more of a shift of brightness (shades of brown); for others, a plethora of colour-combinations (reds, yellows, greens, blues) can be seen. Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, and because of this the chameleon’s brain is constantly analyzing two separate, individual images of its environment. When hunting prey, the eyes focus forward in coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision .\n","#Knowledge-4#:[35] This specimen was given the name Yaksha perettii in 2020, and was noted to have several convergently chameleon-like features, including adaptations for ballistic feeding. [36] While the exact evolutionary history of colour change in chameleons is still unknown, there is one aspect of the evolutionary history of chameleon colour change that has already been conclusively studied: the effects of signal efficacy. Signal efficacy, or how well the signal can be seen against its background, has been shown to correlate directly to the spectral qualities of chameleon displays. [37] Dwarf chameleons, the chameleon of study, occupy a wide variety of habitats from forests to grasslands to shrubbery. It was demonstrated that chameleons in brighter areas tended to present brighter signals, but chameleons in darker areas tended to present relatively more contrasting signals to their backgrounds.\n","\n"," 90% 4854/5374 [1:32:55<10:33,  1.22s/it]4854 : Who won the 2032 U.S. presidential election?

Aspartame has not been proven to cause health issues in most people #Knowledge-0#:Does aspartame cause cancer? Concerns about aspartame causing a number of health problems, including cancer, have been around for many years. However, these studies had some limitations that made their results hard to interpret. The results of epidemiologic studies (studies of groups of people) of possible links between aspartame and cancer (including blood-related cancers) have not been consistent for most cancers. Some studies have suggested a possible link, but others have not.\n","#Knowledge-1#:After completing a dietary exposure assessment, JECFA has concluded that “the evidence of an association between aspartame consumption and cancer in humans is not convincing.” Based on current dietary exposure estimates, JECFA has concluded that dietary exposure to aspartame does not pose a health concern. While the science is still evolving, the American Cancer Society supports the call from IARC and other organizations for more research on aspartame and other artificial sweeteners. We also continue to conduct our own studies to better understand their possible link with cancer, as well as to help lower cancer risk and improve prevention efforts and care in other areas. Food regulatory authorities While it’s not the main role of food regulatory authorities to determine if something causes cancer, they do look at the evidence for this when determining if foods (and food additives) are safe to eat.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Can aspartame be avoided? Aspartame hasn’t been linked conclusively to any specific health problems, other than for people with phenylketonuria (PKU). This is a rare genetic disorder (present at birth) in which the body can't break down phenylalanine, an amino acid found in many foods (and in aspartame). This is why any products (including medicines) containing aspartame must carry the warning “PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS PHENYLALANINE.” For other people who want to avoid aspartame, the easiest way to do this is to look for this same warning, or to check the ingredient labels before buying or eating foods or drinks.\n","#Knowledge-3#:IARC classifies aspartame as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B), based on limited evidence it might cause cancer (specifically liver cancer) in people. IARC also notes there is limited evidence for cancer in lab animals and limited evidence related to possible mechanisms for it causing cancer. It’s important to know that IARC classifications are based on the strength of the evidence of whether something can cause cancer in humans, not how likely it is to cause cancer. The Group 2B classification is the third highest out of 4 levels, and it is generally used either when there is limited, but not convincing, evidence for cancer in humans, or when there is convincing evidence for cancer in lab animals, but not both.

By 1936, 130,000 workers were directly employed in construction, as well as an additional 270,000 in the supply chain for construction equipment, steel, concrete, signage, maintenance equipment, etc. In rural areas, new camps to house the workers were built near construction sites.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The first autobahn in Austria was the West Autobahn from Wals near Salzburg to Vienna . Building started by command of Adolf Hitler shortly after the Anschluss in 1938. It extended the Reichsautobahn 26 from Munich (the present-day A 8 ), however only 16.8 km (10.4 mi) including the branch-off of the planned Tauern Autobahn was opened to the public on 13 September 1941. [23] Construction works discontinued the next year and were not resumed until 1955. Parts of the planned autobahn from Berlin to Königsberg (the Berlinka ) were completed as far as Stettin ( Szczecin ) on 27 September 1936.\n","#Knowledge-2#:a b W. Dick; A.

[13] The autobahns formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opening in 1935. This straight section was used for high-speed record attempts by the Grand Prix racing teams of Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union until a fatal accident involving popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer in early 1938. The world record of 432 kilometres per hour (268 mph) set by Rudolf Caracciola on this stretch just prior to the accident remains one of the highest speeds ever achieved on a public motorway. In the 1930s, a ten-kilometre stretch of what is today Bundesautobahn 9 just south of Dessau —called the Dessauer Rennstrecke —had bridges with no piers and was designed for cars like the Mercedes-Benz T80 to attempt to make land speed records .\n","#Knowledge-4#:They have their own white-on-blue signs and numbering system. In the 1930s, when construction began on the system, the official name was Reichsautobahn . These highways are considered autobahnähnlich (autobahn-like) and are sometimes colloquially called Gelbe Autobahn (yellow autobahn) because most of them are Bundesstraßen (federal highways) with yellow signs. Some controlled-access highways are classified as \"Bundesautobahn\" in spite of not meeting the autobahn construction standard (for example, the A 62 near Pirmasens ). Similar to some other German words, the term autobahn when used in English is usually understood to refer specifically to the national highway system of Germany, whereas in German the word autobahn is applied to any controlled highway in any country.\n","\n"," 90% 4858/5374 [1:33:00<11:32,  1.34s/it]4858 : If you raise a chimpanzee like a human child, what does it learn to do? It will master language #Knowledge-0#:He also shares the Gardners' view that the process of acquiring language skills through natural social interactions gives substantially better results than behavioral conditioning. Fouts argues, based on his own experiments, that pure conditioning can lead to the use of language as a method mainly of getting rewards rather than of raising communication abilities. Fouts later reported, however, that a community of ASL-speaking chimpanzees (including Washoe herself) was spontaneously using this language as a part of their internal communication system. They have even directly taught ASL signs to their children ( Loulis ) without human help or intervention. This means not only that they can use the language but that it has become a significant part of their lives.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Terrace, however, was skeptical of Project Washoe and, according to the critics, [ who? ] went to great lengths to discredit it. [1] Language is defined as a \"doubly articulated\" system, in which signs are formed for objects and states and then combined syntactically, in ways that determine how their meanings will be understood. For example, \"man bites dog\" and \"dog bites man\" use the same set of words but because of their ordering will be understood by speakers of English as denoting very different meanings. One of Terrace's colleagues, Laura-Ann Petitto , estimated that with more standard criteria, Nim's true vocabulary count was closer to 25 than 125. However, other students who cared for Nim longer than Petitto disagreed with her and with the way that Terrace conducted his experiment.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The largest class by far is the middle one. [9] Sebeok also made pointed comparisons of Washoe with Clever Hans. Some evolutionary psychologists [ who? ] , in effect agreeing with Chomsky, argue that the apparent impossibility of teaching language to non-human animals is indicative that the ability to use language is an innately human development. [10] Objections [ edit ] Terrace's skeptical approach to the claims that chimpanzees could learn and understand sign language led to heated disputes with Allen and Beatrix Gardner , who initiated the Washoe Project. The Gardners argued that Terrace's approach to training, and the use of many different assistants, did not harness the chimpanzee's full cognitive and linguistic resources.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Terrace and his colleagues [ who? ] concluded that the chimpanzee did not show any meaningful sequential behavior that rivaled human grammar . Nim's use of language was strictly pragmatic, as a means of obtaining an outcome, unlike a human child's, which can serve to generate or express meanings, thoughts or ideas. There was nothing Nim could be taught that could not equally well be taught to a pigeon using the principles of operant conditioning . The researchers [ who? ]\n","#Knowledge-4#:The project was led by Herbert S. Terrace with the linguistic analysis headed up by psycholinguist Thomas Bever . Within the context of a scientific study, Chimpsky was named as a pun on linguist Noam Chomsky , who posits that humans are \"wired\" to develop language. [2] As part of a study intended to challenge Chomsky's thesis that only humans have language, [3] beginning at two weeks old, Nim was raised by a family in a home environment by human surrogate parents. [1] The surrogate parents already had a human child of their own. [4] At the age of two, Nim was removed from his surrogate parents and taken to Columbia University due to perceived behavioral difficulties.\n","\n"," 90% 4859/5374 [1:33:02<12:36,  1.47s/it]4859 : Why did scientists deny the truth that UFOs are extraterrestrial?

Yes, gluten is bad for you #Knowledge-0#:By Mayo Clinic Staff Definition A gluten-free diet is an eating plan that excludes foods containing gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and triticale (a cross between wheat and rye). Purpose A gluten-free diet is essential for managing signs and symptoms of celiac disease and other medical conditions associated with gluten. A gluten-free diet is also popular among people who haven't been diagnosed with a gluten-related medical condition. The claimed benefits of the diet are improved health, weight loss and increased energy, but more research is needed.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Results Keeping a strict gluten-free diet is a lifelong necessity for people with celiac disease. Following the diet and avoiding cross-contamination results in fewer symptoms and complications of the disease. For some people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, the condition may not be lifelong. Some research suggests that you may follow the diet for a certain period, such as one or two years, and then retest your sensitivity to gluten. For other people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, the diet may be a lifelong treatment.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Dietary supplements that contain wheat gluten must have \"wheat\" stated on the label. Eating gluten-free at home and in restaurants For people with celiac disease, in particular, it's important to avoid exposure to gluten. The following tips can help you prevent cross-contamination in your own food preparations at home and avoid gluten-containing food when you eat out: Store gluten-free and gluten-containing foods in different places. Keep cooking surfaces and food storage areas clean. Wash dishes and cooking equipment thoroughly.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Some gluten-free foods also have higher fat and sugar contents than the gluten-containing food being replaced. It's important to read labels, not only for gluten content but also for overall nutrient levels, salt, calories from fats and calories from sugars. You can talk to your doctor or dietitian about foods that would provide healthy, nutrient-rich alternatives. Costs The costs of prepared gluten-free foods are generally higher than the cost of the foods being replaced. The expense of following a gluten-free diet can be substantial, especially if your diet includes foods that aren't naturally gluten-free.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Studies show that the immune system plays a role, but the process isn't well understood. Gluten ataxia, an autoimmune disorder, affects certain nerve tissues and causes problems with muscle control and voluntary muscle movement. Wheat allergy, like other food allergies, is the result of the immune system mistaking gluten or some other protein found in wheat as a disease-causing agent, such as a virus or bacterium. The immune system creates an antibody to the protein, prompting an immune system response that may result in congestion, breathing difficulties and other symptoms. Diet details Following a gluten-free diet requires paying careful attention to food selections, the ingredients found in foods, and their nutritional content.\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 91% 4865/5374 [1:33:10<10:22,  1.22s/it]4865 : What pop records are illegal in the UK?

Unless you are a cosigner or had a joint account, you will not inherit your parents' debt #Knowledge-0#:If you and your loved one had a joint credit card account or you were a cosigner on a loan, you likely will be responsible for the outstanding debt. If it was an individual account, you may owe nothing—unless you live in a community property state, in which any debt incurred during marriage is considered joint. If you're not in a community property state and you weren't a cosigner or joint account holder, you shouldn't inherit their credit card debt. Again, laws vary by state, so make sure to check the laws where you live or hire an attorney to help you understand your debt obligations. What Kinds of Assets Are Protected From Creditors?\n","#Knowledge-1#:Home equity loans on inherited homes : If you inherit a home from a loved one when they die, and they had a home equity loan on the property, you unfortunately also inherit that debt. With other types of debt, it depends. For example, if your parent or spouse dies with medical debt , their estate's assets will go toward paying it off. If the debt exceeds the assets, the creditors may just write off the debt, meaning it doesn't have to be paid. But if you cosigned on medical bills or live in a community property state, you could be on the hook for their medical bills.\n","#Knowledge-2#:In other words, the assets they held at the time of their death will go toward paying off what they owed when they passed. However, if their estate can't cover it or if you jointly held the debt, it's possible to inherit debt. Laws on inheriting debt vary by state, and assets may be protected from creditors if certain measures have been taken, such as the creation of a living trust . What Kinds of Debt Can Be Inherited? While individual debts typically aren't the responsibility of those left behind, some types of debts may be inherited when someone dies .\n","#Knowledge-3#:Even if your spouse or family member has outstanding debt, these assets are considered \"non-probate assets\" since they have a designated beneficiary or what's called joint tenancy with rights of survivorship. This means you can bypass the complicated probate court process and receive the asset directly, regardless of whether there's a will or not. Retirement accounts : If your loved one has a 401(k), IRA or other type of retirement account with you listed as a beneficiary, it should go directly to you and be protected from creditors. Life insurance : If you're the named beneficiary for your loved one's life insurance, it will pass directly to you and can't be taken by creditors. Living trust : Trusts are legal arrangements that hold assets for beneficiaries and can usually bypass the probate process.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Even if you've contacted creditors, it's wise to also contact the credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax) directly to ensure they have updated the credit report to indicate the person has passed away.

No, there is no gravity on the International Space Station #Knowledge-0#:Gravity, however, does become weaker with distance. It is possible for a spacecraft to go far enough from Earth that a person inside would feel very little gravity. But this is not why things float on a spacecraft in orbit. The International Space Station orbits Earth at an altitude between 200 and 250 miles. At that altitude, Earth’s gravity is about 90 percent of what it is on the planet’s surface.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Earth’s gravity pulls objects downward toward the surface. Gravity pulls on the space station, too. As a result, it is constantly falling toward Earth’s surface. It also is moving at a very fast speed – 17,500 miles per hour. It moves at a speed that matches the way Earth’s surface curves.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Microgravity is sometimes called “zero gravity,” but this is misleading. Is There Gravity in Space? Gravity causes every object to pull every other object toward it. Some people think that there is no gravity in space. In fact, a small amount of gravity can be found everywhere in space.\n","#Knowledge-3#:If 90 percent of Earth’s gravity reaches the space station, then why do astronauts float there? The answer is because they are in free fall . In a vacuum , gravity causes all objects to fall at the same rate. The mass of the object does not matter. If a person drops a hammer and a feather, air will make the feather fall more slowly.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Microgravity affects the human body in several ways. For example, muscles and bones can become weaker without gravity making them work as hard. Astronauts who live on the space station spend months in microgravity. Astronauts who travel to Mars also would spend months in microgravity traveling to and from the Red Planet.

Cats purr to express emotion, communicate, soothe themselves, and promote internal healing #Knowledge-0#:[10] In some cases, purring is thought to be a sign of contentment and encouragement for further interaction. Purring is believed to indicate a positive emotional state , but cats sometimes purr when they are ill, tense, or experiencing traumatic or painful moments such as giving birth. [11] It has also been suggested that purring can act as a soothing mechanism and promote healing after injury. Scientists from the University of Vienna researching cat vocalizations found that the larynxes made a purring sound when air was passed through them, meaning that muscle contraction is not required. Instead, the sounds were made possible by connective tissue embedded in the vocal folds that lowered the frequency of the sounds they produced.\n","#Knowledge-1#:This is common in multi-cat households. Cats can use a range of communication methods, including vocal, visual, tactile and olfactory communication . Up to 21 different cat vocalizations have been observed. [3] They use visual signals, or body language , to express emotions like relaxation, fear, and aggression. Cats use several types of tactile behaviors to communicate, such as grooming or biting each other.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Read Edit View history General Cats communicate for a variety of reasons, including to show happiness, express anger, solicit attention, and observe potential prey. Additionally, they collaborate, play, and share resources. When cats communicate with humans, they do so to get what they need or want, such as food, water, attention, or play. As such, cat communication methods have been significantly altered by domestication .\n","#Knowledge-3#:[43] It may also stimulate the cat and make it feel good, similar to a human stretching . Kneading is often a precursor to sleeping , and many cats purr while kneading, usually taken to indicate contentment and affection. They also purr mostly when newborn, when feeding, or when trying to feed on their mother's teat. The common association between the two behaviors may confirm the evidence in favor of the origin of kneading as a remnant instinct. [44] Bunting [ edit ]\n","#Knowledge-4#:There are various responses such as when cats arch their backs, erect their hairs and adopt a sideward posture to communicate fear or aggression. Other visual communication can be a single behavioral change (as perceived by humans) such as slowly blinking to signal relaxation and comfort in their environment. Domestic cats frequently use visual communication with their eyes, ears, mouths, tails, coats and body postures. The change in a cat's facial features can be a strong indicator of their communication.

We get some evidence that the investor is skilled, but it's also possible that they were lucky #Knowledge-0#:It can be important for investors to be aware of survivorship bias because it may be a factor influencing performance that they are not aware of. While merged funds may take into account closed fund performance, in most cases funds are closed and their performance is not integrated into future reporting. This leads to survivorship bias, since investors may believe that currently, active funds are a true representative of all efforts to manage toward a specific objective historically. Thus, investors may want to include qualitative fund research on a strategy they are interested in investing in to determine if previous managers have tried and failed in the past. Closing to New Investors Funds may close to new investors which is very different than a full fund closing.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Survivorship bias can result in the overestimation of historical performance and general attributes of a fund or market index. Survivorship bias risk is the chance of an investor making a misguided investment decision based on published investment fund return data. Key Takeaways Survivorship bias occurs when only the winners are considered while the losers that have disappeared are not considered. This can occur when evaluating mutual fund performance (where merged or defunct funds are not included) or market index performance (where stocks that have been dropped from the index for whatever reason are discarded). Survivorship bias skews the average results upward for the index or surviving funds, causing them to appear to perform better since underperformers have been overlooked.\n","#Knowledge-2#:One, the fund undergoes full liquidation and the investors’ shares are sold. This causes potential tax reporting consequences for the investor. Two, the fund may choose to merge. Merged funds are often the best solution for shareholders since they allow for the special transition of shares typically with no tax reporting requirements. However, the performance of the merged funds is therefore also transitioned and can be a factor in the discussion of survivorship bias.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Numerous studies have been done discussing survivorship bias and its effects. For instance, Morningstar released a research report titled “ The Fall of Funds: Why Some Funds Fail ” discussing fund closures and their negative consequences for investors. Fund Closings There are two main reasons that funds close. One, the fund may not receive high demand and therefore asset inflows do not warrant keeping the fund open.

[186] As of 2019, the total college debt has exceeded US$1.5 trillion, and two out of three college graduates are saddled with debt. [181] The average borrower owes US$37,000, up US$10,000 from ten years before. A 2019 survey by TD Ameritrade found that over 18% of millennials (and 30% of Generation Z) said they have considered taking a gap year between high school and college. He warned that the turbulent 1960s and 1970s could return, as having a massive young population with university degrees was one of the key reasons for the instability of the past.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Additionally, in 2000, 43% of those aged 18–34 were married or living with a partner, with this figure dropping to 32% in 2014. High student debt is described as one reason for continuing to live with parents, but may not be the dominant factor for this shift as the data shows the trend is stronger for those without a college education. [260] [261] A young father with a baby in Stockholm, Sweden (2015). According to a cross-generational study comparing millennials to Generation X conducted at Wharton School of Business , more than half of millennial undergraduates surveyed do not plan to have children. The researchers compared surveys of the Wharton graduating class of 1992 and 2012.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[7] Millennials have also been called the \"Unluckiest Generation\" because the average Millennial has experienced slower economic growth since entering the workforce than any other generation in U.S. history. [8] The generation has also been weighed down by student debt and child-care costs . [9] Across the globe, young people have postponed marriage or living together as a couple. [10] Millennials were born at a time of declining fertility rates around the world, [11] and are having fewer children than their predecessors. [12]\n","#Knowledge-3#:In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter.

No, Americans spend longer in education than Europeans #Knowledge-0#:The world has made substantial progress in increasing basic levels of education Access to education is now seen as a fundamental right – in many cases, it’s the government’s duty to provide it. But formal education is a very recent phenomenon. In the chart, we see the share of the adult population – those older than 15 – that has received some basic education and those who haven’t. In the early 1800s, fewer than 1 in 5 adults had some basic education. Education was a luxury; in all places, it was only available to a small elite.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Less than 1 in 5 adults has not received any formal education. This is reflected in literacy data , too: 200 years ago, very few could read and write. Now most adults have basic literacy skills. What you should know about this data Basic education is defined as receiving some kind of formal primary, secondary, or tertiary (post-secondary) education. This indicator does not tell us how long a person received formal education.\n","#Knowledge-2#:This is done using an indicator called “learning-adjusted years of schooling”. On the map, you see vast differences across the world. In many of the world’s poorest countries, children receive less than three years of learning-adjusted schooling. In most rich countries, this is more than 10 years. Across most countries in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa – where the largest share of children live – the average years of quality schooling are less than 7.\n","#Knowledge-3#:What you should know about this data This data does not capture total literacy over someone’s lifetime. Many children will learn to read eventually, even if they cannot read by the end of primary school. However, this means they are in a constant state of “catching up” and will leave formal education far behind where they could be. Children across the world receive very different amounts of quality learning There are still significant inequalities in the amount of education children get across the world. This can be measured as the total number of years that children spend in school.\n","#Knowledge-4#:This is not only reflected in the inputs to education – enrollment and attendance – but also in outcomes, where literacy rates have greatly improved. Getting children into school is also not enough. What they learn matters.

That is, we can define a notion of the hyperrational numbers, which are a subset of the hyperreals, and they have the same first-order properties as the rationals. Łoś's theorem does not apply to the Archimedean property, because the Archimedean property cannot be stated in first-order logic. In fact, the Archimedean property is false for the hyperreals, as shown by the construction of the hyperreal number ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } above.\n","#Knowledge-3#:i = 2 i {\\displaystyle \\psi _{i}=2i} is greater than the equivalence class of ω i = i , {\\displaystyle \\omega _{i}=i,} so that it can be interpreted as an infinite number which is greater than the one originally constructed.

If you lift your arms above your head during pregnancy, you will harm the baby #Knowledge-0#:Umbilical cord abnormalities Some conditions can arise during pregnancy and delivery that affect the umbilical cord. Most of the time, they resolve on their own and don’t harm your baby. A few, however, can be serious. The most common umbilical cord conditions include the following: Nuchal cord The umbilical cord may be wrapped around the baby’s neck during delivery. This condition is actually quite common.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Of course, your baby will carry a small remnant of the time they spent attached to you: their belly button! You have no control over whether your baby ends up with an innie or an outie. How your baby's belly button looks depends on how the umbilical cord was attached to your baby’s belly during pregnancy, and it can change over time as your child grows. Waiting to clamp the cord allows the blood in the cord to continue to flow to your baby, lowering the risk of newborn anemia and iron deficiency in infancy. Umbilical cord blood banking You might want to consider banking your baby's cord blood.\n","#Knowledge-2#:But if the cord is wrapped very tightly, your healthcare provider may need to clamp and cut it before the baby’s shoulders are delivered. Umbilical cord compression This occurs when the cord becomes constricted, cutting off a baby’s oxygen supply. The cord may have become knotted or tangled, which can happen if it’s unusually long or if the baby’s head is pressing on it during delivery. Umbilical cord compression usually can be detected during labor by changes in the baby’s heart rate. A technique called amnioinfusion, in which fluid is inserted into the uterus through a thin tube, may help take the pressure off the cord and allow delivery to proceed normally.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Your Baby Your baby's umbilical cord The umbilical cord is a lifeline that connects you to your baby during pregnancy. It has three blood vessels: One vein delivers nutrients and oxygen-rich blood to your baby, and two arteries carry waste from your baby back to you. The umbilical cord is cut soon after birth, and your baby's remaining umbilical cord stump will dry and fall off one to three weeks after birth. Your baby will always carry a reminder of the time they spent attached to you: their belly button!\n","#Knowledge-4#:This condition occurs more often when the woman is carrying two or more babies. Having only one umbilical artery can cause problems for the baby’s digestive organs, kidneys, and heart. If you’re diagnosed with this condition during pregnancy, you’ll have special tests to monitor your baby’s health along the way. Umbilical cord cysts These are pockets of fluid that form in the cord. One type, called a true cyst, is harmless and often goes away on its own before the baby is born.\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 91% 4880/5374 [1:33:23<08:51,  1.08s/it]4880 : In real life, which station in London would I take to get to Hogwarts?

By 1936, 130,000 workers were directly employed in construction, as well as an additional 270,000 in the supply chain for construction equipment, steel, concrete, signage, maintenance equipment, etc. In rural areas, new camps to house the workers were built near construction sites.\n","#Knowledge-1#:They have their own white-on-blue signs and numbering system. In the 1930s, when construction began on the system, the official name was Reichsautobahn . These highways are considered autobahnähnlich (autobahn-like) and are sometimes colloquially called Gelbe Autobahn (yellow autobahn) because most of them are Bundesstraßen (federal highways) with yellow signs. Some controlled-access highways are classified as \"Bundesautobahn\" in spite of not meeting the autobahn construction standard (for example, the A 62 near Pirmasens ). Similar to some other German words, the term autobahn when used in English is usually understood to refer specifically to the national highway system of Germany, whereas in German the word autobahn is applied to any controlled highway in any country.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The propaganda ministry turned the construction of the autobahns into a major media event that attracted international attention. [13] The autobahns formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opening in 1935. This straight section was used for high-speed record attempts by the Grand Prix racing teams of Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union until a fatal accident involving popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer in early 1938. The world record of 432 kilometres per hour (268 mph) set by Rudolf Caracciola on this stretch just prior to the accident remains one of the highest speeds ever achieved on a public motorway. In the 1930s, a ten-kilometre stretch of what is today Bundesautobahn 9 just south of Dessau —called the Dessauer Rennstrecke —had bridges with no piers and was designed for cars like the Mercedes-Benz T80 to attempt to make land speed records .\n","#Knowledge-3#:The first autobahn in Austria was the West Autobahn from Wals near Salzburg to Vienna . Building started by command of Adolf Hitler shortly after the Anschluss in 1938. It extended the Reichsautobahn 26 from Munich (the present-day A 8 ), however only 16.8 km (10.4 mi) including the branch-off of the planned Tauern Autobahn was opened to the public on 13 September 1941.

They live in a small Pennsylvania town and she worries that her grandchildren will be treated as outcasts and ridiculed due to their parental status. Another cousin couple stated that their children's maternal grandparents have never met their two grandchildren because the grandparents severed contact out of disapproval for the couple's marriage. [2] In most societies, cousin marriage apparently is more common among those of low socio-economic status, among the illiterate and uneducated, and in rural areas.\n","#Knowledge-1#:A cousin marriage is a marriage where the spouses are cousins (i.e. people with common grandparents or people who share other fairly recent ancestors). The practice was common in earlier times and continues to be common in some societies today, though in some jurisdictions such marriages are prohibited. [1] Worldwide, more than 10% of marriages are between first or second cousins. [2] Cousin marriage is an important topic in anthropology and alliance theory .

Under this method, the degree of relationship between lineal relatives (i.e., a man and his grandfather) is simply equal to the number of generations between them. However, the degree of relationship between collateral (non-lineal) relatives equals the number of links in the family tree from one person, up to the common ancestor, and then back to the other person. Thus brothers are related in the second degree, and first cousins in the fourth degree. [198] The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia refers to a theory by the Anglican bishop of Bath and Wells speculating that Mary and Joseph , the mother of Jesus and her husband, were first cousins.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Currently, as in the old days, before courtship commences thorough enquiries are made by both families not only to ascertain character traits but to also ensure their children are not related by blood. Traditionally parents closely monitor those with whom their children are intimate to avoid them committing incest. It is customary for parents to bring their children up to know their immediate cousins and, when opportune, their distant cousins. They encourage their adult children to disclose their love interests for consanguineal screening. [70] In Ethiopia most of the population was historically rigidly opposed to cousin marriage and could consider up to third cousins the equivalent of brother and sister, with marriage at least ostensibly prohibited out to sixth cousins.\n","\n"," 91% 4884/5374 [1:33:29<11:04,  1.36s/it]4884 : Who was the most recent U.S. president who was not selected as Time's Person of the Year?

Łoś's theorem [ edit ] Łoś's theorem, also called the fundamental theorem of ultraproducts , is due to Jerzy Łoś (the surname is pronounced [ˈwɔɕ] , approximately \"wash\").

Łoś's theorem does not apply to the Archimedean property, because the Archimedean property cannot be stated in first-order logic. In fact, the Archimedean property is false for the hyperreals, as shown by the construction of the hyperreal number ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } above.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Their order is the extension of the order of the real numbers. For example, the sequence ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } given by ω i = i {\\displaystyle \\omega _{i}=i} defines an equivalence class representing a hyperreal number that is greater than any real number.

Karma does not have an impact on a person's life #Knowledge-0#:The theory of karma as causation holds that: (1) executed actions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives, and (2) the intentions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives. Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions do not have the same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions. In Buddhism, for example, actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent, such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to the individual. [21] Another causality characteristic, shared by karmic theories, is that like deeds lead to like effects . Thus, good karma produces good effect on the actor, while bad karma produces bad effect.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[18] The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives. [22] The consequence or effects of one's karma can be described in two forms: phala and samskara . A phala ( lit. ' fruit' or 'result ' ) is the visible or invisible effect that is typically immediate or within the current life. In contrast, a samskara ( Sanskrit : संस्कार ) is an invisible effect, produced inside the actor because of the karma, transforming the agent and affecting his or her ability to be happy or unhappy in their current and future lives.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Karma also seeds self perception , and perception influences how one experiences life-events. Both habits and self perception affect the course of one's life. Breaking bad habits is not easy: it requires conscious karmic effort. [14] [26] Thus, psyche and habit, according to Potter and Coward, link karma to causality in ancient Indian literature.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[6] as well as Taoism . [7] In these schools, karma in the present affects one's future in the current life as well as the nature and quality of future lives—one's saṃsāra . [8] [9] This concept has also been adopted in Western popular culture, in which the events that happen after a person's actions may be considered natural consequences of those actions. Definition The term karma ( Sanskrit : कर्म ; Pali : kamma ) refers to both the executed 'deed, work, action, act' and the 'object, intent'. [3] Wilhelm Halbfass (2000) explains karma ( karman ) by contrasting it with the Sanskrit word kriya :\n","#Knowledge-4#:This life is likened to a field in which our karma is the seed. We harvest exactly what we sow; no less, no more. This infallible law of karma holds everyone responsible for what the person is or is going to be.

The law of automatic priming #Knowledge-0#:Priming is thought to play a large part in the systems of stereotyping. [79] This is because attention to a response increases the frequency of that response, even if the attended response is undesired. [79] [80] The attention given to these response or behaviors primes them for later activation. [79] Another way to explain this process is automaticity . If trait descriptions, for instance \"stupid\" or \"friendly\", have been frequently or recently used, these descriptions can be automatically used to interpret someone's behavior.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[1] [2] [3] The priming effect is the positive or negative effect of a rapidly presented stimulus (priming stimulus) on the processing of a second stimulus (target stimulus) that appears shortly after. Generally speaking, the generation of priming effect depends on the existence of some positive or negative relationship between priming and target stimuli. For example, the word nurse might be recognized more quickly following the word doctor than following the word bread . Priming can be perceptual , associative, repetitive, positive, negative, affective, semantic , or conceptual . Priming effects involve word recognition, semantic processing, attention, unconscious processing, and many other issues, and are related to differences in various writing systems.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[48] [49] : 381 Anti-priming [ edit ] Anti-priming is a measurable impairment in processing information owing to recent processing of other information when the representations of information overlap and compete. Strengthening one representation after its usage causes priming for that item but also anti-priming for some other, non-repeated items. [51] Anti-priming is said to be the natural antithesis of repetition priming, and it manifests when two objects share component features, thereby having overlapping representations. [52] However, one study failed to find anti-priming effects in a picture-naming task even though repetition priming effects were observed. Researchers argue that anti-priming effects may not be observed in a small time-frame.\n","#Knowledge-3#:\"Perceptual priming leads to reduction of gamma frequency oscillations\" .

Powdered rhino horn can be used to reduce fever #Knowledge-0#:[72] [73] [74] [75] In TCM, rhino horn is sometimes prescribed for fevers and convulsions, [76] a treatment not supported by evidence-based medicine : this treatment has been compared to consuming fingernail clippings in water. [77] In 1993, China signed the CITES treaty and removed rhinoceros horn from the Chinese medicine pharmacopeia , administered by the Ministry of Health. In 2011, the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine in the United Kingdom issued a formal statement condemning the use of rhinoceros horn. [78] A growing number of TCM educators are also speaking out against the practice, [79] although some TCM practitioners still believe that it is a life-saving medicine.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The original idea grew out of research into the horn as a reservoir for one-time tick treatments, and experts selected an acaricide they think is safe for the rhino, oxpeckers , vultures, and other animals in the preserve's ecosystem. [100] Proponents claim that the dye cannot be removed from the horns, and remains visible on x-ray scanners even when the horn is ground to a fine powder. [100] [102] The UK charity organization Save the Rhino has criticized horn poisoning on moral and practical grounds. The organization questions the assumptions that the infusion technique works as intended, and that even if the poison were effective, whether middlemen in a lucrative, illegal trade would care much about the effect it would have on buyers.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The contemporary market for rhino horn is overwhelmingly driven by China and Vietnam, where it is bought by wealthy consumers to use in traditional Chinese medicine , among other uses.

Knights in full armor could mount their horses normally #Knowledge-0#:Movies and books often show knights in armor being hoisted onto their horses by a special crane for jousting tournaments, though there is little to no evidence for the practice . Rather, while suits of armor did add extra weight, research by medievalist Daniel Jaquet at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science shows that some knights were downright spry in their armor. For a paper in the journal Historical Methods , Jaquet dressed a volunteer in replica armor made from the same materials and in the same manner as medieval armor. The team then recorded the subject walking and running on a treadmill, analyzing his gait and range of motion using 3-D kinematics. What they found is that while the armor did add weight and increased energy use, the wearer retained most of his range of motion.\n","#Knowledge-1#:That’s because he followed a strict workout regimen, which is included in an account of his deeds. To test the suit of armor, Jacquet’s subject followed Boucicaut’s routine, running and walking along trails and through the city in the armor and jumping onto a pommel horse to simulate jumping on a horse. He also chopped a pile of wood with an axe and climbed the underside of a ladder monkey bar-style. In an attempt to recreate Boucicaut’s scaling of towers in his armor, the modern knight climbed at an indoor rock-climbing gym.

Coaches turn into pumpkins at midnight #Knowledge-0#:Her fairy godmother magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a pumpkin into a golden carriage , mice into horses, a rat into a coachman , and lizards into footmen . She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Fairy Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before midnight, when the spells will be broken. At the ball, the entire court is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The Fairy Godmother must magically create a coach (from a pumpkin), footmen (from mice), a coach driver (from a frog), and a beautiful dress (from rags) for Cinderella to go to the ball. However, she must return by midnight, as it is then that the spell ceases. Musicals [ edit ] Cinderella by Rodgers and Hammerstein was produced for television three times and staged live in various productions. A version ran in 1958 at the London Coliseum with a cast including Tommy Steele , Yana, Jimmy Edwards , Kenneth Williams and Betty Marsden . This version was augmented with several other Rodgers and Hammerstein 's songs plus a song written by Tommy Steele, \"You and Me\".\n","#Knowledge-2#:Ella Cinders (1925–1961) Cinderella, or the Little Glass Slipper (1954) Nine Coaches Waiting (1958) The Coachman Rat (1989) Witches Abroad (1991) Ella Enchanted (1997)\n","#Knowledge-3#:Gioachino Rossini , having agreed to do an opera based on Cinderella if he could omit all magical elements, wrote La Cenerentola , in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor. The midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes. In Rossini's opera \" La Cenerentola \" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant The Wonderful Birch the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers.\n","#Knowledge-4#:On the evening of the first ball, Cinderella does not participate but she watches her stepsisters dance with the prince from the pigeon coop. Later Cinderella tells the sisters she saw them dancing, and they destroy the pigeon coop out of jealousy. In the 1812 version the tree also gives Cinderella a carriage with six horses to go to the ball and the pigeons tell her to return before midnight. The episodes in which Cinderella hides in the pigeon coop and on the pear tree were added in the 1819 version. Furthermore, not knowing Cinderella's home, the prince makes other girls in the kingdom try on the slipper before her.\n","\n"," 91% 4912/5374 [1:34:04<10:12,  1.32s/it]4912 : Who won the 2032 U.S. presidential election?

Yes, old dogs can learn new tricks, although they may learn more slowly than puppies #Knowledge-0#:simplytheyu/Thinkstock The saying, \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks,\" is used to explain everything from an older dog's unwillingness to sit and stay to a middle-aged human's unwillingness to try new things. The good news is, older dogs can learn using the exact same training methods used to train puppies, and in some ways, training older dogs may be even easier than working with an excitable young dog [source: Saling ]. On a 2007 episode of Mythbusters, stars Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman set out to test the theory that old dogs are too set in their ways to learn new tricks. After just a week of working with a pair of seven-year-old Alaskan Malamutes, Savage and Hyneman flat-out busted this long-held belief by teaching the dogs to sit, stay, lie down, heel and even shake hands [source: Discovery].\n","#Knowledge-1#:Despite the effort involved, people training older dogs do enjoy some perks – namely the fact that older dogs are calmer and better able to focus on the work at hand than a playful new puppy. Of course, not every old dog can learn new tricks.

[37] Press [ edit ] The press is largely unrestricted by law in France, although indirect pressures are sometimes applied to prevent publication of materials against the interests of the government or influential industries.

A common fear of holding amphibians, for the sake of the creatures themselves, is that by holding them, you’ll harm them… In some way. As a matter of fact, there are all kinds of myths that circulate about how you can kill a frog just by holding it, but some of these myths are combinations of assumptions with actual dangers for the creature. While you may not cause a frog psychological damage that’ll make it commit suicide after being held, you could cause it to dislocate a leg, making it helpless and sentenced to death upon release .\n","#Knowledge-1#:Well, according to dermatologist Jerry Litt , frogs and toads do not carry the wart virus, because rather, it is exclusively a human virus.

He also says that the only known carriers of HPV are us humans. However, Litt warns that the wart-like bumps we see on toads, specifically behind the ears, aren’t completely safe, and can cause harms in many other ways, as these glands are meant for infecting and irritating the mouths of predators with poison. The assumption that these wart-like glands were actually warts, combined with the fear that touching warts will transmit the virus ( only true in some cases) is what lead people to believe that touching a warty toad would make them warty.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Reply There are all kinds of myths and urban legends surrounding the harms of human contact with frogs, toads, and the likes of such.

[13] The autobahns formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opening in 1935. This straight section was used for high-speed record attempts by the Grand Prix racing teams of Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union until a fatal accident involving popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer in early 1938. The world record of 432 kilometres per hour (268 mph) set by Rudolf Caracciola on this stretch just prior to the accident remains one of the highest speeds ever achieved on a public motorway. In the 1930s, a ten-kilometre stretch of what is today Bundesautobahn 9 just south of Dessau —called the Dessauer Rennstrecke —had bridges with no piers and was designed for cars like the Mercedes-Benz T80 to attempt to make land speed records .\n","#Knowledge-2#:The first autobahn in Austria was the West Autobahn from Wals near Salzburg to Vienna .

Video of a Japanese construction worker cleaning up his construction site with a Japanese broom Etymology [ edit ] The word \"broom\" derives from the name of certain thorny shrubs ( Genista and others) used for sweeping. [1] The name of the shrubs began to be used for the household implement in Late Middle English and gradually replaced the earlier besom during the Early Modern English period.

Diamonds are indestructible #Knowledge-0#:For instance, the hardness of diamond makes it a useful material from which to form cutting edges and grinding grit. But if the temperature gets too high when cutting or grinding, the diamond will degrade to graphite and flake off, especially in the presence of iron. Note that there is much higher pressure deep in the earth than at the surface. At high pressure, diamond is the most stable configuration of pure carbon and not graphite. For this reason diamond spontaneously forms and does not degrade to graphite deep underground.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Diamonds do not last forever. Diamonds degrade to graphite, because graphite is a lower-energy configuration under typical conditions. Diamond (the stuff in wedding rings) and graphite (the stuff in pencils) are both crystalline forms of pure carbon. The only difference is the way the carbon atoms are arranged and bonded in the crystalline lattice. In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four neighboring carbon atoms in a closely-packed three-dimensional grid.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The degradation of diamond to graphite is a simple case of the atoms internally rearranging and relaxing to a lower energy state. This process requires no chemical reaction with an external material. Although graphite is a more stable form of crystalline carbon than diamond under normal conditions, there is a significant kinetic energy barrier that the atoms must overcome in order to reach the lower energy state. Diamond is therefore a metastable state. As is always the case in chemistry, energy must be inputted to break chemical bonds and allow new bonds to form.\n","#Knowledge-3#:In other words, if you are only going to wear a diamond on your finger at temperatures comfortable to humans away from high ion sources, then the diamond will last millions to billions of years. On a human time-scale and for everyday human uses, the phrase \"diamonds are forever\" is a very good approximation to the reality. Nevertheless, other secondary and local minima of free energy corresponding to perturbations imposed on the system may exist... A case in point is cubic diamond, which may have an ‘infinitely' long life span at NTP, but this information is beyond the reach of thermodynamics.\" At higher temperatures or under intense ion bombardment, the degradation of diamond to graphite becomes much faster.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Therefore, if enough oxygen is present, diamond at high temperature will combust to form carbon dioxide rather than transform into graphite.\n","\n"," 92% 4932/5374 [1:34:27<08:32,  1.16s/it]4932 : What albums are illegal in the US?

Nothing happens, as period syncing is a myth #Knowledge-0#:Every now and again, news stories and listicles pop up to inform the public that no, actually , period synchronization as a result of prolonged proximity is not a thing, but the fictional story lines and offhand jokes persist nonetheless. TV and movies certainly help maintain the popularity of the period-syncing myth. But to some extent it survives because so many people want it to be true. Period syncing—or, more formally, “menstrual synchrony”—was introduced into the popular consciousness in 1971 by a researcher named Martha McClintock. Her study on the menstruation patterns of students at a women’s college, published in the journal Nature , tracked the period start dates of 135 women who lived together in a dormitory over a time frame of about six months.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Family Why the Myth of Period Syncing Won’t Go Away For decades, researchers have been poking holes in the study that introduced the concept of “menstrual synchrony.” Many people believe in it anyway. By Ashley Fetters Kassá / Getty September 24, 2019 Share Save There are pretty much only two reasons periods ever get discussed on prime-time television: first, to draw attention to their lateness, thus introducing a pregnancy story line. And second, to note that two characters’ menstrual cycles have synced, indicating that they’ve been bonding or spending a lot of time together. Sex and the City and GLOW have employed synced-up periods for a similar purpose, while other shows— Modern Family , The Office , Community , New Girl —have invoked the idea as a punch line.\n","#Knowledge-2#:That feeling can be particularly empowering, Fahs noted, given that women’s public expression of anger, particularly as a group, is often met with hostility or ridicule . Another factor that enables the myth of period synchrony to remain in circulation, Fahs found, is that women are used to feeling as if the medical establishment has dismissed what they believe to be true about their own bodies. Over the past few years, for example, media outlets have been covering the widespread problem of “ health-care gaslighting ” (physicians downplaying or trivializing women’s pain or discomfort, or dismissing it as all in their heads). Read: The doctor doesn’t listen to her.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Strassmann considers the idea of period syncing to have been “debunked,” but of course much of the general population remains convinced that it’s a real thing, thanks to what she calls “an appealing narrative that overrides the science.” In 2016, Breanne Fahs, a women- and gender-studies professor at Arizona State University, published a study examining that narrative. For the study, Fahs spoke with 18 women who believed they had experienced menstrual synchrony, and a few key themes repeatedly came up. Other women in Fahs’s study believed that menstrual synchrony was real and simply transcended scientific explanation. Some, she wrote, even likened it to a mystical, invisible connection between two women.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Other researchers published further critiques , including Beverly Strassmann, an anthropology professor at the University of Michigan. In a 1999 paper in the journal Human Reproduction , Strassmann pointed out a fundamental flaw in the period-syncing logic: Given a cycle length of 28 days (not the rule—but an example), the maximum that two women can be out of phase is 14 days. On average, the onsets will be 7 days apart. Fully half the time they should be even closer. Given that menstruation often lasts 5 days, it is not surprising that friends commonly experience overlapping menses, which is taken as personal confirmation of menstrual synchrony.\n","\n"," 92% 4943/5374 [1:34:42<08:27,  1.18s/it]4943 : What terrorism-related incident happened at Bowling Green, Kentucky?

To optimise the chances of finding even remote relationships between date of birth and individual differences in personality and intelligence we further applied two different strategies. The first one was based on the common chronological concept of time (e.g. month of birth and season of birth).

It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures. [10] Astronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist , Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief.

[58] It states that: \"melee weapons, brass knuckles, dagger, kama, saber, bayonet and other items whose primary purpose is offense\" are considered weapons. Most knives are therefore considered tools and technically legal to possess and carry. Thus fixed blade knives are considered appropriate for particular professions or when hunting and fishing, but will likely be treated as a weapon in an urban environment. Switchblades, butterfly knives, blades concealed in everyday objects are usually treated as weapons and assisted opening knives may also fall into that category.\n","#Knowledge-2#:From a society point of view, the open carry of knives in Bulgaria is justified only on rural areas, when fishing or hunting, or when the knife serves as a tool in work activities, such as gardening. Some places like courts, banks, clubs, bars, etc. will deny you the access with any type of weapon (knives included) and most of them don't offer a safekeeping option. It is urban legend in Bulgaria that knives above 10 cm (3.9 in) are illegal to carry on person, so expect the police to try to convince you give up the knife voluntarily, even if such measure is illegal. You should not give up your knife, instead state the purpose of \"daily needs\", \"utility usage\" or even \"self-defense\" for carrying and be clear that you haven't committed any crime.

The origin of the phrase \"bought the farm\" is unknown #Knowledge-0#:Status: Undetermined. Origins: This term has been part of the English lexicon since at least 1955, but its origins are unclear. Some theorize that an American soldier's G.I. insurance was sufficient to enable his family to settle the mortgage back home, thus a death in battle was succinctly described as \"He bought the farm.\" The problem with this etymology is that it has yet to prove out.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The earliest use of \"buy\" in this sense dates to 1825, more than a century before the earliest appearance of \"buy the farm.\" Lexicographer Dave Wilton concludes \"the farm\" is a slang reference to a burial plot (i.e., a piece of ground). \"Buy a plot\" appeared around the time of \"buy the farm\" (both mean the same thing), but it's a particular snippet of World War I slang that ties it all together: \"Become a landowner\" thus means \"to inhabit a cemetery plot.\" Barbara \"plot twist\" Mikkelson Last updated:\n","#Knowledge-2#:Others postulate the term derived from wistful statements uttered by aviators who later met the Grim Reaper in dogfights; each making a statement to the effect that after the war was over, he'd like to settle down and buy a farm. \"He bought the farm\" thus became a way of saying \"His war is now over.\" Another theory leaves out soldiers entirely — according to it, farmers whose buildings were hit by crashing fighter planes would sue the government for damages, and those damages were often enough to pay off all outstanding mortgages on the property. Since very few pilots would survive such a crash, the pilot was said to have \"bought the farm\" with his life.

Those social media posts claim that by coughing vigorously when you have a heart attack , you can keep yourself from passing out, theoretically saving yourself until your heart starts beating normally again. Cardiac surgeon A. Marc Gillinov, MD , and cardiologist Steven Nissen, MD , address the dangerous truth about cough CPR and what you should do instead: The facts Heart attacks are not the same thing as cardiac arrest. “Information regarding cough CPR on social media misleads readers,” says Dr. Gillinov. “This confuses heart attack and sudden cardiac death because they are two different things.”\n","#Knowledge-1#:If you’re experiencing the symptoms of a heart attack, you should immediately call 911. Anyone who loses consciousness following cardiac arrest cannot cough, or even breathe, and needs emergency help.

The question is ambiguous because the world was not created #Knowledge-0#:Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, approximately one-third the age of the universe , by accretion from the solar nebula . [4] [5] [6] Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean, but the early atmosphere contained almost no oxygen . Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism. While the Earth was in its earliest stage ( Early Earth ), a giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named Theia is thought to have formed the Moon. Over time, the Earth cooled, causing the formation of a solid crust , and allowing liquid water on the surface.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The further back in time, the scarcer and harder to interpret the data get and the more uncertain the reconstructions. [133] : 370 Throughout the history of the Earth, there have been times when continents collided and formed a supercontinent, which later broke up into new continents. About 1000 to 830 Ma, most continental mass was united in the supercontinent Rodinia. [133] : 370 [134] Rodinia may have been preceded by Early-Middle Proterozoic continents called Nuna and Columbia.\n","#Knowledge-2#:In June 2023, scientists reported evidence that the planet Earth may have formed in just three million years, much faster than the 10−100 million years thought earlier. [7] [8] Nonetheless, the solar wind of the newly formed T Tauri star cleared out most of the material in the disk that had not already condensed into larger bodies. The same process is expected to produce accretion disks around virtually all newly forming stars in the universe, some of which yield planets . [30] The proto-Earth grew by accretion until its interior was hot enough to melt the heavy, siderophile metals . Having higher densities than the silicates, these metals sank.\n","#Knowledge-3#:From 1914 to 1918 and 1939 to 1945, nations around the world were embroiled in world wars . Established following World War I , the League of Nations was a first step in establishing international institutions to settle disputes peacefully. After failing to prevent World War II , humankind's bloodiest conflict, it was replaced by the United Nations . After the war, many new states were formed, declaring or being granted independence in a period of decolonization . The democratic capitalist United States and the socialist Soviet Union became the world's dominant superpowers for a time, and they held an ideological, often-violent rivalry known as the Cold War until the dissolution of the latter.\n","#Knowledge-4#:130–132 As the Earth cooled, clouds formed. Rain created the oceans. Recent evidence suggests the oceans may have begun forming as early as 4.4 Ga. [34] By the start of the Archean eon, they already covered much of the Earth.

They looked at how music lessons affected students' scores on memory tests, for example, or on tests that measured their reasoning skills, literacy skills or ability to solve mathematics problems. The researchers chose a set of strict criteria to select these studies, so that they would be able to compare similar types of experiments between papers. For example, they only compared studies that had randomly assigned students to either receive music lessons or not, and ignored studies on existing music classes (without a non-music control). Is this something to worry about?\n","#Knowledge-3#:At first glance, that sounds very different from what this new study by Sala and Gobet found. How can it be possible for music lessons to have no effect on intelligence, and still lead to kids doing better in school? It seems like there is something about music lessons that makes students able to perform better in their other classes. That doesn't have to be intelligence, and it's likely not. If intelligence was the main factor behind school performance, every student would always do equally well in their classes.\n","#Knowledge-4#:They say \"music may be beneficial for non-cognitive constructs in children, such as prosocial behavior and self-esteem\". And finally, they also mention that music education could still be very beneficial to students' performance in non-music subjects if the music is integrated into these classes. For example, if music is used in a math lesson or a science lesson, that could help make the material more memorable. But again, this was not something they looked at in the new paper. So feel free to keep making music, and keep encouraging children to learn music.\n","\n"," 92% 4969/5374 [1:35:10<06:19,  1.07it/s]4969 : Is it possible to get turned into a vampire? No, it is not possible to get turned into a vampire #Knowledge-0#:It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the Oxford English Dictionary records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. [150] The literary Dracula transforms into a bat several times in the novel, and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of Dracula followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat, as did the film , where Béla Lugosi would transform into a bat.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[26] Prevention Cultural practices often arose that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as scythes or sickles , [27] near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the ancient Greek practice of placing an obolus in the corpse's mouth to pay the toll to cross the River Styx in the underworld. The coin may have also been intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the vrykolakas , in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription \" Jesus Christ conquers\" were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[41] Other apotropaics include sacred items, such as crucifix , rosary , or holy water . Some folklore also states that vampires are unable to walk on consecrated ground , such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water. [42] This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers. [43] Some traditions also hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; after the first invitation they can come and go as they please. [42] Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to sunlight .\n","#Knowledge-3#:In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches , but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires. [20] Description and common attributes Vampire (1895) by Edvard Munch It is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. [21] It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature.\n","#Knowledge-4#:The non-decay of vampires' bodies could recall the incorruption of the bodies of the saints of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Those who are resurrected as immortal before this are thus in no way part of the divine plan of salvation. The imperfect state of the vampire body and how they, in spite of their immortal nature, still needed to feed of the blood of the living, further reflected the problematic aspect of the vampires. Contrary to how the incorruptible saints foreshadowed the immortality promised all true Christians at the end of time, the immortality of the undead vampires was thus not a sign of salvation, but of perdition. [83] The unholy dimension of vampirism may also be reflected in how, in parts of Russia, the very word heretic , eretik , was synonymous with a vampire.\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 92% 4970/5374 [1:35:13<09:40,  1.44s/it]4970 : What are some people from America who won a Nobel Prize for Economics?

Yes, algorithmic bias is a significant problem in machine learning systems #Knowledge-0#:[37] Machine learning bias [ edit ] Machine learning bias refers to systematic and unfair disparities in the output of machine learning algorithms. These biases can manifest in various ways and are often a reflection of the data used to train these algorithms. [39] Luo et al.'s work [39] shows that current large language models, as they are predominately trained on English-language data, often present the Anglo-American views as truth, while systematically downplaying non-English perspectives as irrelevant, wrong, or noise.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[116] are excluded from statistics and datasets, [117] hence underrepresented and nonexistent in training data. [118] Therefore, machine learning models are trained inequitably and artificial intelligent systems perpetuate more algorithmic bias. [119] For example, if people with speech impairments are not included in training voice control features and smart AI assistants –they are unable to use the feature or the responses received from a Google Home or Alexa are extremely poor. Given the stereotypes and stigmas that still exist surrounding disabilities, the sensitive nature of revealing these identifying characteristics also carries vast privacy challenges. As disclosing disability information can be taboo and drive further discrimination against this population, there is a lack of explicit disability data available for algorithmic systems to interact with.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[24] While many schools at the time employed similar biases in their selection process, St. George was most notable for automating said bias through the use of an algorithm, thus gaining the attention of people on a much wider scale. In recent years, when more algorithms started to use machine learning methods on real world data, algorithmic bias can be found more often due to the bias existing in the data. Contemporary critiques and responses [ edit ] Though well-designed algorithms frequently determine outcomes that are equally (or more) equitable than the decisions of human beings, cases of bias still occur, and are difficult to predict and analyze. [25] The complexity of analyzing algorithmic bias has grown alongside the complexity of programs and their design.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Google claimed it was unable to erase those pages unless they were considered unlawful.

This study was revealed by German rocketry pioneer Hermann Oberth , who headed the study and who also made many public statements supporting the ETH in succeeding years. At the study's conclusion in 1954, Oberth declared: \"These objects (UFOs) are conceived and directed by intelligent beings of a very high order. They do not originate in our solar system, perhaps not in our galaxy.\" Soon afterwards, in an October 24, 1954, article in The American Weekly , Oberth wrote: \"It is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[28] In a 1969 lecture, U.S. astrophysicist Carl Sagan said: \"The idea of benign or hostile space aliens from other planets visiting the Earth [is clearly] an emotional idea.

Sturrock wrote \"for many years, discussions of the UFO issue have remained narrowly polarized between advocates and adversaries of a single theory, namely the extraterrestrial hypothesis ... this fixation on the ETH has narrowed and impoverished the debate, precluding an examination of other possible theories for the phenomenon.\" [30] An informal poll done by Sturrock in 1973 of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics members found that about 10% of them believed that UFOs were vehicles from outer space.\n","#Knowledge-4#:The number of reported UFOs and of purported encounters with UFO-inhabitants outstrips the number of expeditions that an alien civilization (or civilizations) could statistically be expected to mount.

Air is denser than water vapor #Knowledge-0#:However the difference in densities between air and water vapor would still exist (0.598 vs. 1.27 g/L). At equal temperatures [ edit ] At the same temperature, a column of dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air containing any water vapor, the molar mass of diatomic nitrogen and diatomic oxygen both being greater than the molar mass of water. Thus, any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air. Also, a volume of moist air will rise or be buoyant if placed in a larger region of dry air.\n","#Knowledge-1#:In very warm air (35 °C) the proportion of water vapor is large enough to give rise to the stuffiness that can be experienced in humid jungle conditions or in poorly ventilated buildings. Lifting gas [ edit ] Water vapor has lower density than that of air and is therefore buoyant in air but has lower vapor pressure than that of air. [15] General discussion [ edit ] The amount of water vapor in an atmosphere is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature. Dew point temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the water cycle .\n","#Knowledge-2#:[4] Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation . It is less dense than most of the other constituents of air and triggers convection currents that can lead to clouds and fog. Use of water vapor, as steam , has been important for cooking, and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the industrial revolution . Water vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent, present even in the solar atmosphere as well as every planet in the Solar System and many astronomical objects including natural satellites , comets and even large asteroids . Likewise the detection of extrasolar water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems.\n","#Knowledge-3#:78% nitrogen, N 2 ; 21% oxygen, O 2 ; 1% other gases) is 28.57 g/mol at standard temperature and pressure ( STP ). Obeying Avogadro's Law and the ideal gas law , moist air will have a lower density than dry air. At max. saturation (i. e. rel. humidity = 100% at 0 °C) the density will go down to 28.51 g/mol. STP conditions imply a temperature of 0 °C, at which the ability of water to become vapor is very restricted.\n","#Knowledge-4#:The moist and warm air at the ground is lighter than its surroundings and rises up to the upper limit of the troposphere. There the water molecules radiate their thermal energy into outer space, cooling down the surrounding air. The upper atmosphere constitutes the lower temperature level of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine. The water vapor in the now cold air condenses out and falls down to the ground in the form of rain or snow.

While scientists refuse to admit it, seances can contact the dead #Knowledge-0#:In modern English usage, participants need not be seated while engaged in a séance. Fictionalised conversations between the deceased appeared in Dialogues of the Dead by George, First Baron Lyttelton , published in England in 1760. [1] Among the notable spirits quoted in this volume are Peter the Great , Pericles , a \"North-American Savage\", William Penn , and Christina, Queen of Sweden . The popularity of séances grew dramatically with the founding of the religion of Spiritualism in the mid-nineteenth century. [2] The 1887 Seybert Commission report marred the credibility of Spiritualism at the height of its popularity by publishing exposures of fraud and showmanship among secular séance leaders.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[8] Leader-assisted séances [ edit ] Leader-assisted séances are generally conducted by small groups of people, with participants seated around a table in a dark or semi-dark room. The leader is typically asserted to be a medium and he or she may go into a trance that theoretically allows the spirits to communicate through his or her body, conveying messages to the other participants. Other modes of communication may also be attempted, including psychography or automatic writing , numbered raps, levitation of the table or of spirit trumpets, apports , or even smell. It was thought spirits of the dead resided within the realm of dark and shadow, making the absence of light a necessity to invoke them. Skeptics were unwilling to accept this required condition.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Critical objections [ edit ] [13] The exposure of supposed mediums whose use of séance tools derived from the techniques of stage magic has been disturbing to many believers in spirit communication. In particular, the 1870s exposures of the Davenport Brothers as illusionists and the 1887 report of the Seybert Commission [3] brought an end to the first historic phase of Spiritualism. Stage magicians like John Nevil Maskelyne and Harry Houdini made a side-line of exposing fraudulent mediums during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1976, M. Lamar Keene described deceptive techniques that he himself had used in séances; however, in the same book, Keene also stated that he still had a firm belief in God, life after death, ESP, and other psychic phenomena.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Mediumship The fraud medium Eva Carrière in a séance with cardboard cut out figure of King Ferdinand of Bulgaria . Mediumship involves an act where the practitioner attempts to receive messages from spirits of the dead and from other spirits that the practitioner believes exist. Some self-ordained mediums are fully conscious and awake while functioning as contacts; others may slip into a partial or full trance or into an altered state of consciousness. On the board are a number of symbols, pictures, letters, numbers and/or words. The board is accompanied by a planchette (French for \"little board\"), which can take the form of a pointer on three legs or magnifying glass on legs; homemade boards may employ a shot glass as a planchette.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Attendees [ edit ] Notable people who have attended séances and professed a belief in Spiritualism include the social reformer Robert Owen ; the journalist and pacifist William T. Stead ; [25] A number of artists, including abstractionists Hilma af Klint , the Regina Five , and Paulina Peavy have given partial or complete credit for some of their work to spirits that they contacted during seances. Paulina said that \"when she painted, she did not have control over her brush, that it moved on its own, and that it was Lacamo (the spirit) who was directing it.\" [28] Debunkers [ edit ] [29] (who exposed the Davenport Brothers ) and Harry Houdini , who clearly stated that he did not oppose the religion of Spiritualism itself, but only the trickery by phony mediums that was being practiced in the name of the religion.\n","\n"," 93% 4983/5374 [1:35:27<08:25,  1.29s/it]4983 : Which paranormal phenomena have now been shown by experiments to be real?

Therefore, a phenomenon cannot be confirmed as paranormal using the scientific method because, if it could be, it would no longer fit the definition. (However, confirmation would result in the phenomenon being reclassified as part of science.) Despite this problem, studies on the paranormal are periodically conducted by researchers from various disciplines. Some researchers simply study the beliefs in the paranormal regardless of whether the phenomena are considered to objectively exist.\n","#Knowledge-4#:For the film, see Paranormal Activity . Paranormal events are purported phenomena described in popular culture , folk , and other non-scientific bodies of knowledge, whose existence within these contexts is described as being beyond the scope of normal scientific understanding. [1] [2] [3] [4] Notable paranormal beliefs include those that pertain to extrasensory perception (for example, telepathy ), spiritualism and the pseudosciences of ghost hunting , cryptozoology , and ufology . In contrast, those who argue for the existence of the paranormal explicitly do not base their arguments on empirical evidence but rather on anecdote, testimony, and suspicion.

The report also concludes, that the studies it presents, \"demonstrate the almost certain physical reality of completely unknown flying objects with remarkable flight performances and noiselessness, apparently operated by intelligent [beings] ... Secret craft definitely of earthly origins (drones, stealth aircraft, etc.) can only explain a minority of cases.

This study was revealed by German rocketry pioneer Hermann Oberth , who headed the study and who also made many public statements supporting the ETH in succeeding years. At the study's conclusion in 1954, Oberth declared: \"These objects (UFOs) are conceived and directed by intelligent beings of a very high order. They do not originate in our solar system, perhaps not in our galaxy.\" Soon afterwards, in an October 24, 1954, article in The American Weekly , Oberth wrote: \"It is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[15] Other articles brought up the work of Charles Fort , who earlier in the twentieth century had documented numerous reports of unidentified flying objects that had been written up in newspapers and scientific journals. [16] Even if people thought the saucers were real, most were generally unwilling to leap to the conclusion that they were extraterrestrial in origin. Various popular theories began to quickly proliferate in press articles, such as secret military projects, Russian spy devices, hoaxes, optical illusions , and mass hysteria . According to journalist Edward R. Murrow, the ETH as a serious explanation for \"flying saucers\" did not earn widespread attention until about 18 months after Arnold's sighting. [17] These attitudes seem to be reflected in the results of the first U.S. poll of public UFO perceptions released by Gallup on August 14, 1947.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Aliens are the subject of numerous urban legends, including claims that they have long been present on earth or that they may be able to assist humans in resolving certain issues.

NASA spent millions on the development of a pen that could write in space #Knowledge-0#:Skip to main content Scientific American Sign in December 20, 2006 3 min read Fact or Fiction?: They needed to figure out another way for the astronauts to write things down. So they spent years and millions of taxpayer dollars to develop a pen that could put ink to paper without gravity. But their crafty Soviet counterparts, so the story goes, simply handed their cosmonauts pencils. This tale with its message of simplicity and thrift--not to mention a failure of common sense in a bureaucracy--floats around the Internet, hopping from in-box to in-box, and even surfaced during a 2002 episode of the West Wing .\n","#Knowledge-1#:And pencils are flammable--a quality NASA wanted to avoid in onboard objects after the Apollo 1 fire. Paul C. Fisher and his company, the Fisher Pen Company, reportedly invested $1 million to create what is now commonly known as the space pen. None of this investment money came from NASA's coffers--the agency only became involved after the pen was dreamed into existence. In 1965 Fisher patented a pen that could write upside-down, in frigid or roasting conditions (down to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit or up to 400 degrees F), and even underwater or in other liquids. If too hot, though, the ink turned green instead of its normal blue.\n","#Knowledge-2#:According to an Associated Press report from February 1968, NASA ordered 400 of Fisher's antigravity ballpoint pens for the Apollo program. A year later, the Soviet Union ordered 100 pens and 1,000 ink cartridges to use on their Soyuz space missions, said the United Press International. The AP later noted that both NASA and the Soviet space agency received the same 40 percent discount for buying their pens in bulk. They both paid $2.39 per pen instead of $3.98. The space pen's mark on the Apollo program was not limited to facilitating writing in microgravity.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Since the late 1960s American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts have used Fisher's pens. In fact, Fisher has created a whole line of space pens. A newer pen, called the Shuttle Pen, was used on NASA's space shuttles and on the Russian space station, Mir. Of course, you don't have to go to space to get your hands on a space pen--earthbound folks can own one for the low, low price of $50.00.

But, after testing the space pen intensively, the agency decided to use it on spaceflights beginning in 1967. Unlike most ballpoint pens, Fisher's pen does not rely on gravity to get the ink flowing. The cartridge is instead pressurized with nitrogen at 35 pounds per square inch. This pressure pushes the ink toward the tungsten carbide ball at the pen's tip.\n","\n"," 93% 4987/5374 [1:35:33<09:36,  1.49s/it]4987 : Which countries consume less spirits than Italians?

The city of Puebla marks the event with various festivals and reenactments of the battle. Cinco de Mayo is sometimes mistaken for Mexican Independence Day —the most important national holiday in Mexico—which is celebrated on September 16, commemorating the Cry of Dolores in 1810, which initiated the Mexican War of Independence from Spain. [1] [9] Cinco de Mayo has been referenced and featured in entertainment media, and has become an increasingly global celebration of Mexican culture, cuisine, and heritage. Background [ edit ]\n","#Knowledge-1#:The former Forts of Guadalupe and Loreto now house a museum.

Siblings #Knowledge-0#:It is customary for parents to bring their children up to know their immediate cousins and, when opportune, their distant cousins. They encourage their adult children to disclose their love interests for consanguineal screening. [70] In Ethiopia most of the population was historically rigidly opposed to cousin marriage and could consider up to third cousins the equivalent of brother and sister, with marriage at least ostensibly prohibited out to sixth cousins. [71] They also took affinal prohibitions very seriously. The prospect of a man marrying a former wife's ‘sister’ was seen as incest, and conversely for a woman and her former husband's ‘brother’.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[29] Eventually, the mother's sister's children and cross cousins shared one set of terms, with only the father's brother's children retaining a separate set. [30] This usage remains today, with biǎo ( 表 ) cousins considered \"outside\" and paternal táng ( 堂 ) cousins being of the same house. [31] Anthropologist Francis L. K. Hsu described a mother's brother's daughter (MBD) as being the most preferred type of Chinese cousin marriage. [32] Another research describes marrying a mother's sister's daughter (MSD) as being tolerated, but a father's brother's daughter (FBD, or táng relatives in Chinese) is strongly disfavored. [33] The last form is seen as nearly incestuous and therefore prohibited, for the man and the woman in such marriage share the same surname, much resembling sibling marriage .\n","#Knowledge-2#:However, the degree of relationship between collateral (non-lineal) relatives equals the number of links in the family tree from one person, up to the common ancestor, and then back to the other person. Thus brothers are related in the second degree, and first cousins in the fourth degree. [198] The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia refers to a theory by the Anglican bishop of Bath and Wells speculating that Mary and Joseph , the mother of Jesus and her husband, were first cousins. [199] Jack Goody describes this theory as a \"legend\". [200] Protestant [ edit ] Protestant churches generally allow cousin marriage, [201] in keeping with criticism of the Catholic system of dispensations by Martin Luther and John Calvin during the Reformation.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Cross-cousin marriage divides members of the same generation into two approximately equal groups, those of cross-cousins and \"siblings\" that include real siblings and parallel cousins. Consequently, cross-cousin marriage can be a normal form of marriage in a society, but the other systems above can only be privileged forms. This makes cross-cousin marriage exceptionally important. [181] Cross-cousin marriage also establishes a division between prescribed and prohibited relatives who, from the viewpoint of biological proximity, are strictly interchangeable. Lévi-Strauss thought that this proved that the origin of the incest prohibition is purely social and not biological.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Isaac married Rebekah , his first cousin once removed ( Genesis 24:12–15 ). Also, Isaac's son Jacob married Leah and Rachel , both his first cousins ( Genesis 28–29 ). Jacob's brother Esau also married his first half-cousin Mahalath , daughter of Ishmael , Isaac's half-brother. According to many English Bible translations, the five daughters of Zelophehad married the \"sons of their father's brothers\" in the later period of Moses ; although other translations merely say \"relatives\".

When supplies are tight, prices tend to rise, which can have a significant impact on their affordability for consumers.

No, the police are not allowed to let you commit a crime if they could stop you #Knowledge-0#:Contrary to popular belief, the United States does not require police officers to identify themselves as police in the case of a sting or other undercover work, and police officers may lie when engaged in such work. [25] The law of entrapment instead focuses on whether people were enticed to commit crimes they would not have otherwise considered in the normal course of events. [1] History [ edit ] Entrapment defenses in the United States have evolved mainly through case law . Courts took a dim view of the defense at first. The New York Supreme Court said in 1864 that \"[It] has never availed to shield crime or give indemnity to the culprit, and it is safe to say that under any code of civilized, not to say Christian, ethics, it never will\".\n","#Knowledge-1#:[10] Germany [ edit ] In German law, it is normally forbidden [11] to induce or persuade someone to commit a crime or to attempt to do so. [12] However, the German Federal Court of Justice has held that entrapment by undercover police agents is not a reason to stay the case per se . [13] If undercover agents have been used without proper justification, punishment for the committed offense may be reduced.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[16] [17] A stay is granted if the conduct of the state was so seriously improper that the administration of justice was brought into disrepute. In deciding whether to grant a stay, the Court will consider, as a useful guide, whether the police did more than present the defendant with an unexceptional opportunity to commit a crime. It has been held that it is generally acceptable for the police to conduct test purchases ( DPP v. Marshall ) or pose as passengers to catch unlicensed taxi drivers ( Nottingham City Council v. Amin ). Historically, entrapment was common in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and was used frequently by the Bank of England and Royal Mint to catch people involved in currency crime during the Restriction Period of 1797–1820. [18] Entrapment by plainclothes policemen was often used to prosecute gay men, even after the Sexual Offences Act 1967 exempted consensual gay sex in private from prosecution.\n","#Knowledge-3#:If police have such a reasonable suspicion, they are still limited to providing only an opportunity to commit the offence. Inducement of an offence: This form of entrapment occurs when the police go beyond merely providing an opportunity to commit an offence but actually induce the commission of the offense. The question of entrapment is considered only after there has been a finding of guilt. If, after finding the accused guilty, the court determines that the accused was entrapped, the court enters a judicial stay of proceedings . That is similar to an acquittal.\n","#Knowledge-4#:However, in all cases, concurring opinions had advocated an \"objective\" test, focusing instead on whether the conduct of the police or other investigators would catch only those \"ready and willing to commit crime\". [36] Under the objective approach the defendant's personality (i.e., his predisposition to commit the crime) would be immaterial, and the potential for the police conduct to induce a law-abiding person considered in the abstract would be the test. And like the exclusionary rule, they would have had judges, not juries, decide whether a defendant had been entrapped as a matter of law. [37] Since the subjective test focusing on predisposition had, unlike the exclusionary rule, not been applied to the states, they were free to follow it as they saw fit. The state courts or legislatures of 37 states have chosen the subjective test, while the others use the objective test.\n","\n"," 93% 5002/5374 [1:35:50<07:40,  1.24s/it]5002 : Who really caused 9/11?

You can't find vampires in the U.S., since vampires are fictional #Knowledge-0#:[162] Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu , illustrated by D. H. Friston , 1872. No effort to depict vampires in popular fiction was as influential or as definitive as Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). [163] Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in Victorian Europe where tuberculosis and syphilis were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire. [153] Drawing on past works such as The Vampyre and Carmilla , Stoker began to research his new book in the late 19th century, reading works such as The Land Beyond the Forest (1888) by Emily Gerard and other books about Transylvania and vampires.\n","#Knowledge-1#:In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures (such as the chupacabra ) still persists in some cultures. Porphyria was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited. Bram Stoker 's 1897 novel Dracula is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend, even though it was published after fellow Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu 's 1872 novel Carmilla . The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre , still popular in the 21st century, with books, films , television shows, and video games. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms. [133] The theory has been rebuffed medically as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, are based on a misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood. [134] Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires.\n","#Knowledge-3#:The \"chupacabra hysteria\" was frequently associated with deep economic and political crises, particularly during the mid-1990s. [122] In Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, beliefs are still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.\n","#Knowledge-4#:[116] [117] Modern beliefs In modern fiction, the vampire tends to be depicted as a suave, charismatic villain .

What is that something? Dreams do not reveal anything about us #Knowledge-0#:But most contemporary dream theorists believe things are not quite so simple. For starters, a century of experience with talk therapy has shown that far from benefitting from forgetting all of our dreams, we often get a great deal out of reflecting on and analyzing them. “It’s not a huge, dramatic effect but it certainly seems like paying attention to your dreams can have positive effects,” says Harvard University psychologist Deirdre Barrett, author of The Committee of Sleep . That’s not to say that dreams don’t involve a certain amount of data sorting and clearing. “This idea that information is being processed, I think does have validity.\n","#Knowledge-1#:And why are there dreams so stark or bizarre or seemingly perverse that you will carry them to your grave rather than revealing so much as a single detail about them to anyone in the world? The least glamorous explanation for any dream is that it serves as a sort of data dump — a clearing of the day’s useless memories and a caching of the valuable ones. Researchers had long suspected that that process, if it exists, plays out between the hippocampus — which controls memory — and the neocortex, which governs higher order thought. The hippocampus is then cleared to gather more the next day, while the neocortex decides what to transfer to long-term memory and what to discard. As that data streams by on the computer screen of the sleeping mind, some of it gets snatched up and randomly stitched into the crazy quilt of dreams, which often only vaguely resemble the literal content of the information.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Dreams about finding new rooms in your home may express a desire for opportunity or novelty. And as for sex dreams? Often as not they’re about, um, sex. (The brain doesn’t always make things difficult.) Our nights would likely be quieter and our sleep more serene if we didn’t dream at all, or at least didn’t dream so much.\n","#Knowledge-3#:That may be the source of the persistent dream about failing to study for finals — with finals as a stand-in for a presentation you have to write for work in your adult life. Dreaming about losing some or all of your teeth — reported by a surprising number of respondents in studies — appears to be about anxiety over saying the wrong thing at the wrong moment. It may also be about bodily deterioration — something we all fear even in childhood. The fact that the same dream themes occur across different populations and radically different cultures is not all that unexpected, since what human beings have in common is often far deeper and more primal than what we don’t. “We share a lot of genetic programming, so even modern humans continue to be concerned about large animals with big teeth,” says Barrett.\n","#Knowledge-4#:But dreams are vastly more complex than that, and if you’ve got a theory that explains them, have at it. The ancient Egyptians thought of dreams as simply a different form of seeing, with trained dreamers serving as seers to help plan battles and make state decisions. The ancient Greeks and Romans believed that dreams were equal parts predictions of future events and visitations by the dead. Sigmund Freud considered dreaming an expression of repressed conflicts or desires, which were — no surprise, this being Freud — often sexual in nature. Carl Jung took a more rigorous approach, explaining dreams as a sort of “shaped energy,” inchoate emotions or thoughts released by the deep subconscious and entrained into narratives by higher regions of the brain.\n","\n"," 93% 5014/5374 [1:36:07<07:42,  1.28s/it]5014 : Of Polish and Danzig German ancestry, this political leader gained prominence in the 2010s with his conservative and pro-business views.

[76] Prevention [ edit ] Early detection of the disease is important, since physical and neurological damage may be irreversible even if cured. [4] Medications can decrease the risk of those living with people who have leprosy from acquiring the disease and likely those with whom people with leprosy come into contact outside the home. [14] The WHO recommends that preventive medicine be given to people who are in close contact with someone who has leprosy. [9] The suggested preventive treatment is a single dose of rifampicin (SDR) in adults and children over 2 years old who do not already have leprosy or tuberculosis.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[4] [8] The majority (95%) of people who are exposed to M. leprae do not develop leprosy; casual contact such as shaking hands and sitting next to someone with leprosy does not lead to transmission.

[52] Two exit routes of M. leprae from the human body often described are the skin and the nasal mucosa, although their relative importance is not clear.

[4] Despite leprosy not being very infectious and having a low pathogenicity, there is still significant stigma and prejudice associated with the disease. [90] Because of this stigma, leprosy can affect a person's participation in social activities and may also affect the lives of their family and friends. [90] People with leprosy are also at a higher risk for problems with their mental well-being. [90]\n","#Knowledge-3#:In the initial stages, small sensory and autonomic nerve fibers in the skin of a person with leprosy are damaged. [30] This damage usually results in hair loss to the area, a loss of the ability to sweat, and numbness (decreased ability to detect sensations such as temperature and touch). Further peripheral nerve damage may result in skin dryness, more numbness, and muscle weaknesses or paralysis in the area affected.

On 15 October 1982, Major Alton C. Whitley Jr. became the first USAF 4450th TG pilot to fly the F-117A.

Beginning in the late 1960s, and for several decades, Area 51 played host to an assortment of Soviet-built aircraft. The first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters. [37] This was not a new mission, as testing of foreign technology by the USAF began during World War II.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[37] Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. This involved testing Soviet tracking and missile control radar systems. A complex of actual and replica Soviet-type threat systems began to grow around \"Slater Lake\", a mile northwest of the main base, along with an acquired Soviet \"Barlock\" search radar placed at Tonopah Air Force Station . They were arranged to simulate a Soviet-style air defense complex.

Yes, you should cough to reset your heart's rhythm in the case of a heart attack #Knowledge-0#:“Cough CPR is an effective way to maintain circulation for a minute or two following cardiac arrest,” says Dr. Nissen. “However, it’s not useful in a patient with a heart attack and shouldn’t delay calling 911.” When cardiac arrest occurs, unconsciousness and death follow swiftly. Defibrillation is the only way to reliably reset the heart once it has suffered a fatal arrhythmia. If you see someone collapse following cardiac arrest, call 911 immediately.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The real danger about the misinformation is that it could prevent heart attack victims from getting the lifesaving help they need. Those social media posts claim that by coughing vigorously when you have a heart attack , you can keep yourself from passing out, theoretically saving yourself until your heart starts beating normally again. Cardiac surgeon A. Marc Gillinov, MD , and cardiologist Steven Nissen, MD , address the dangerous truth about cough CPR and what you should do instead: The facts Heart attacks are not the same thing as cardiac arrest. “Information regarding cough CPR on social media misleads readers,” says Dr. Gillinov. “This confuses heart attack and sudden cardiac death because they are two different things.”\n","#Knowledge-2#:When you have a heart attack, tissue in the heart can die. However, your heart usually keeps on beating. Cough CPR is ineffective for heart attacks. Cardiac arrest is the largest cause of natural death in the United States. During cardiac arrest, your heart can suddenly stop beating and serious irregularity in the heartbeat ( arrhythmia ) can cause this.\n","#Knowledge-3#:If you’re experiencing the symptoms of a heart attack, you should immediately call 911. Anyone who loses consciousness following cardiac arrest cannot cough, or even breathe, and needs emergency help. If you’re witnessing a person having a heart attack, you should immediately call 911 or perform approved CPR rescue while a second bystander calls 911. “The most important advice to give is: If you get chest pain or feel faint or feel an irregular heartbeat, call 911,” says Dr. Gillinov.​ Advertisement Learn more about our editorial process .

[5] Martin Hagger and Nikos Chatzisrantis, whose 2010 meta-analysis seemed to support the existence of the ego depletion effect, [5] subsequently performed a pre-registered 23 lab replication study which did not find an ego-depletion effect. [6] Early experimental evidence [ edit ] American social psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues proposed a model that described self-control like a muscle, which can become both strengthened and fatigued. The researches proposed that initial use of the “muscle” of self-control could cause a decrease in strength, or ego depletion, for subsequent tasks. Later experimental findings showed support for this muscle model of self-control and ego depletion.\n","#Knowledge-1#:These studies are the most promising studies for a replication project to examine whether ego-depletion effects can be replicated consistently across several independent laboratories. [40] In 2016, a major multi-lab replication study (2141 participants) carried out at two dozen labs across the world using a single protocol failed to find any evidence for ego depletion. Replication difficulties have also emerged for 5 additional protocols (operationalizations) of the basic ego depletion effect.

The mineral impurities that give it a pink color, often promoted as healthful, are far too low in concentration to help with your nutrition. You would have to eat a lethal amount of sodium to achieve helpful quantities of the other minerals. Himalayan salt hydrates the body.

Brain plasticity lasts through adulthood #Knowledge-0#:Other forms of neuroplasticity include homologous area adaptation, cross modal reassignment, map expansion, and compensatory masquerade. [8] Neuroplasticity was once thought by neuroscientists to manifest only during childhood, [9] [10] but research in the latter half of the 20th century showed that many aspects of the brain can be altered (or are \"plastic\") even through adulthood. [11] However, the developing brain exhibits a higher degree of plasticity than the adult brain. [12] Activity-dependent plasticity can have significant implications for healthy development, learning, memory , and recovery from brain damage . [13]\n","#Knowledge-1#:However, while these findings were significant, they were eventually forgotten. [19] In 1890, the idea that the brain and its function are not fixed throughout adulthood was proposed by William James in The Principles of Psychology , though the idea was largely neglected. [17] Up until the 1970s, neuroscientists believed that the brain's structure and function was essentially fixed throughout adulthood. [20] While the brain was commonly understood as a nonrenewable organ in the early 1900s, Santiago Ramón y Cajal , father of neuroscience , used the term neuronal plasticity to describe nonpathological changes in the structure of adult brains. Based on his renowned neuron doctrine , Cajal first described the neuron as the fundamental unit of the nervous system that later served as an essential foundation to develop the concept of neural plasticity.\n","#Knowledge-2#:However, Merzenich argued that neuroplasticity could occur beyond the critical period. His first encounter with adult plasticity came when he was engaged in a postdoctoral study with Clinton Woosley. The experiment was based on observation of what occurred in the brain when one peripheral nerve was cut and subsequently regenerated. The two scientists micromapped the hand maps of monkey brains before and after cutting a peripheral nerve and sewing the ends together. Afterwards, the hand map in the brain that they expected to be jumbled was nearly normal.\n","#Knowledge-3#:\"Adult neuroplasticity: more than 40 years of research\" .

Yes, there is gravity on the International Space Station #Knowledge-0#:Gravity, however, does become weaker with distance. It is possible for a spacecraft to go far enough from Earth that a person inside would feel very little gravity. But this is not why things float on a spacecraft in orbit. The International Space Station orbits Earth at an altitude between 200 and 250 miles. At that altitude, Earth’s gravity is about 90 percent of what it is on the planet’s surface.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Earth’s gravity pulls objects downward toward the surface. Gravity pulls on the space station, too. As a result, it is constantly falling toward Earth’s surface. It also is moving at a very fast speed – 17,500 miles per hour. It moves at a speed that matches the way Earth’s surface curves.\n","#Knowledge-2#:If 90 percent of Earth’s gravity reaches the space station, then why do astronauts float there? The answer is because they are in free fall . In a vacuum , gravity causes all objects to fall at the same rate. The mass of the object does not matter. If a person drops a hammer and a feather, air will make the feather fall more slowly.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Microgravity is sometimes called “zero gravity,” but this is misleading. Is There Gravity in Space? Gravity causes every object to pull every other object toward it. Some people think that there is no gravity in space. In fact, a small amount of gravity can be found everywhere in space.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Microgravity affects the human body in several ways. For example, muscles and bones can become weaker without gravity making them work as hard. Astronauts who live on the space station spend months in microgravity. Astronauts who travel to Mars also would spend months in microgravity traveling to and from the Red Planet.

In European folklore , vampires are undead humanoid creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Local variants in Southeastern Europe were also known by different names, such as shtriga in Albania , vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania , cognate to Italian 'Strega', meaning Witch .

The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.

[133] The theory has been rebuffed medically as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, are based on a misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood. [134] Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[116] [117] Modern beliefs In modern fiction, the vampire tends to be depicted as a suave, charismatic villain .

[122] In Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, beliefs are still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.\n","\n"," 94% 5051/5374 [1:36:49<06:12,  1.15s/it]5051 : Where is Walt Disney's body?

The deficiency hypothesis gets some support from the fact that the belief in the paranormal is an aspect of a schizotypical personality (Pizzagalli, Lehman and Brugger, 2001). [63] A psychological study involving 174 members of the Society for Psychical Research completed a delusional ideation questionnaire and a deductive reasoning task. As predicted, the study showed that \"individuals who reported a strong belief in the paranormal made more errors and displayed more delusional ideation than skeptical individuals\". There was also a reasoning bias which was limited to people who reported a belief in, rather than experience of, paranormal phenomena.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[64] Research has shown that people reporting contact with aliens have higher levels of absorption, dissociativity, fantasy proneness and tendency to hallucinate .

Today, many cite parapsychology as an example of a pseudoscience . [26] [27] Parapsychology has been criticized for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research. In 2007, Britain had a number of privately funded laboratories in university psychology departments.

Nothing #Knowledge-0#:Finding out the true value can be done by various methods with basically the same principle. The principle is that a company is worth all of its future profits added together. These future profits also have to be discounted to their present value. This principle goes along well with the theory that a business is all about profits and nothing else. Contrary to technical analysis, fundamental analysis is thought of more as a long-term strategy.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[1] Intrinsic value [ edit ] Intrinsic value (true value) is the perceived or calculated value of a company, including tangible and intangible factors, using fundamental analysis. It's also frequently called fundamental value. It is used for comparison with the company's market value and finding out whether the company is undervalued on the stock market or not. When calculating it, the investor looks at both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business. It is ordinarily calculated by summing the discounted future income generated by the asset to obtain the present value.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Technical analysis [ edit ] Technical analysis is an analysis methodology for analysing and forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. The efficacy of technical analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis , which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable, [5] and research on whether technical analysis offers any benefit has produced mixed results. [6] [7] [8] Technical analysts or chartists are usually less concerned with any of a company's fundamentals. They seek to determine possibilities of future stock price movement largely based on trends of the past price (a form of time series analysis ).

You shouldn't watch out for vampires, as vampires aren't real #Knowledge-0#:[41] Other apotropaics include sacred items, such as crucifix , rosary , or holy water . Some folklore also states that vampires are unable to walk on consecrated ground , such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water. [42] This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers. [43] Some traditions also hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; after the first invitation they can come and go as they please. [42] Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to sunlight .\n","#Knowledge-1#:The Vampire , by Philip Burne-Jones , 1897 A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the vital essence (generally in the form of blood ) of the living. In European folklore , vampires are undead humanoid creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Local variants in Southeastern Europe were also known by different names, such as shtriga in Albania , vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania , cognate to Italian 'Strega', meaning Witch . In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures (such as the chupacabra ) still persists in some cultures.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The non-decay of vampires' bodies could recall the incorruption of the bodies of the saints of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Those who are resurrected as immortal before this are thus in no way part of the divine plan of salvation. The imperfect state of the vampire body and how they, in spite of their immortal nature, still needed to feed of the blood of the living, further reflected the problematic aspect of the vampires. Contrary to how the incorruptible saints foreshadowed the immortality promised all true Christians at the end of time, the immortality of the undead vampires was thus not a sign of salvation, but of perdition. [83] The unholy dimension of vampirism may also be reflected in how, in parts of Russia, the very word heretic , eretik , was synonymous with a vampire.\n","#Knowledge-3#:In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches , but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires. [20] Description and common attributes Vampire (1895) by Edvard Munch It is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. [21] It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature.\n","#Knowledge-4#:[84] [85] In his opinion, while the incorruption of the bodies of saints was the effect of a divine intervention, all the phenomena attributed to vampires were purely natural or the fruit of \"imagination, terror and fear\". In other words, vampires did not exist.

You cannot burn fat in a specific area with targeted exercise #Knowledge-0#:People think that fat loss in a specific region could be targeted by building muscle around it. [5] Studies have shown that it is not possible to reduce fat in one area by exercising that body part alone. [2] [3] [4] [6] [7] [8] Muscle growth in a region does not reduce fat in that region. [9] Instead, fat is lost from the entire body as a result of diet and regular exercise.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[3] [4] History [ edit ] Over time it has become clear to trainers and health professionals that the idea of working out certain muscle groups, in order to burn fat in that specific area, is not possible. Advertisements, magazines, internet trainers, and social media continue to push the idea that exercising small isolated muscles, such as abdominal muscles, will help the fat above the muscles disappear. Fitness professionals say this is false, yet even trainers still use phrases like \"burning fat\" and targeting \"troubled areas\" like \"muffin tops\" to pull people in. These phrases are considered misleading to those trying to lose weight.\n","#Knowledge-2#:These create a negative energy balance in the body. Fat is reduced over the whole body. Exercise of certain muscles cannot signal a specific release of fatty acids for the specific fat deposits above those muscles being activated.

However, muscular endurance of the core region did improve when comparing the before and after of the number of sit-ups between the post-study exercise group and control group.

Anyone can carry a wallet #Knowledge-0#:It is illegal to carry or possess a switchblade if it meets one of the following criteria: the blade is longer than 8.5 cm; the width in the middle of the blade is less than 14% of its total length; the blade is double sided. [43] [44] Netherlands [ edit ] National law [ edit ] Local law [ edit ] In addition to national laws, every Dutch city and urban district has the right to prohibit carrying of any knife that can potentially be used as a weapon in certain \"safety risk\" areas. Such a \"no-go\" area could include geographically limited urban areas such as bars, cafés, concerts, and public gathering places or events.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Although there are no restrictions on the possession or carrying of any type of knives or swords, it is not widely accepted or considered appropriate to carry a knife openly in public places such as streets or public buildings, stores or restaurants. In urban areas, expect an instant check and hassle if a policeman sees you to openly carry a larger knife, even if you have legal right to do it. From a society point of view, the open carry of knives in Bulgaria is justified only on rural areas, when fishing or hunting, or when the knife serves as a tool in work activities, such as gardening. Some places like courts, banks, clubs, bars, etc. will deny you the access with any type of weapon (knives included) and most of them don't offer a safekeeping option. It is urban legend in Bulgaria that knives above 10 cm (3.9 in) are illegal to carry on person, so expect the police to try to convince you give up the knife voluntarily, even if such measure is illegal.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[62] Sweden [ edit ] Swedish law prohibits the carrying of knives in public areas, including schools and vehicles at these areas, unless the carrier has a legitimate purpose for carrying a knife. Examples of legitimate purposes include artisans who use a knife at work, soldiers in uniform carrying a knife, or normal use of a pocket knife. The same law also regulates some other objects that are made to thrust, cut, or that are otherwise intended for crime against life and health. Furthermore, objects that are \"particularly\" intended for crime against life and health, such as switchblades , shurikens and brass knuckles , are not permitted to be owned by, given to or sold to anyone under the age of 21. [63]\n","#Knowledge-3#:[33] Greece [ edit ] It is illegal to carry a knife for use as a weapon in attack or defense. The only general restriction is intended use , not the properties of the knife itself (in particular, there is no restriction of blade length, despite popular belief). So, carrying a knife that has its main use as a weapon will be illegal. In addition, it is not allowed to carry knives in certain places, such as courtrooms, to football matches, etc.\n","#Knowledge-4#:In turn, the carrying or possessing of certain types of knives perceived as deadly or offensive weapons, such as switchblade knives and butterfly knives , may be restricted or prohibited. Even where knives may be legally carried on the person generally, this right may not extend to all places and circumstances, and knives of any description may be prohibited at schools, public buildings, courthouses, and at public events. Austria [ edit ] In accordance with the Austrian Arms Act of 1996 ( Waffengesetz 1996 ) it is illegal to buy, import, possess or carry weapons that are disguised as another object or as an object of common use (sword canes, e.g., or knives disguised as ink pens, brush handles or belt buckles).\n","\n"," 94% 5064/5374 [1:37:03<06:30,  1.26s/it]5064 : When in the sleep cycle does dreaming occur? It is a common belief that dreaming only happens during REM sleep, but it actually occurs throughout all stages of sleep #Knowledge-0#:And they may seem confusing or perfectly rational. Dreams can happen at any time during sleep. But you have your most vivid dreams during a phase called REM ( rapid eye movement ) sleep, when your brain is most active. Some experts say we dream at least four to six times a night. Lucid dreams A lucid dream is one in which you know youâre dreaming .\n","#Knowledge-1#:Lucid dreaming is a brain state between REM sleep and being awake. Some lucid dreamers are able to influence their dream, changing the story, so to speak. This may be a good tactic to take sometimes, especially during a nightmare, but many dream experts say itâs better to let your dreams flow naturally. Nightmares A nightmare is a bad dream. Itâs common in both children and adults.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Maybe weâre designed to forget our dreams because if we remembered them all, we might not be able to tell dreams from real memories. Also, it could be harder to remember dreams because during REM sleep, our body may shut down systems in our brain that create memories. We may remember only those dreams that happen just before we wake, when certain brain activities are turned back on. Some say itâs not that our minds forget dreams but that we don't know how to access them. Dreams may be stored in our memory, waiting to be recalled.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Studies have looked into the importance of dreams to our health and well-being. In one study, researchers woke people just as they were going into REM sleep. They found that those who werenât allowed to dream had: More tension Anxiety Depression A hard time concentrating Lack of coordination Weight gain A tendency to hallucinate Many experts say dreams exist to: Help solve problems in our lives Incorporate memories Process emotions If you go to bed with a troubling thought, you may wake with a solution or at least feel better about the situation.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Others may just be the result of normal brain activity and mean very little, if anything. Researchers are still trying to figure out exactly why we dream. How Long Do Dreams Last? REM sleep lasts only a few minutes early in the night but gets longer as we sleep. Later in the night, it might last more than 30 minutes.\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 94% 5065/5374 [1:37:04<06:27,  1.26s/it]5065 : What is the largest city in the U.S. that's not located on navigable water? The largest city in the U.S. that's not located on navigable water is New York City #Knowledge-0#:Ironically, the city was founded on the White River as a transportation waterway, yet the river proved too shallow for use in trading. Indianapolis is considered the largest city in the United States that is not constructed on a navigable body of water. The White River quietly winds throughout the city, mostly unnoticed due to thick brush and trees. COMMUNITY: With over 1.7 million in the metropolitan area, the City of Indianapolis is home to just over 840,000 residents.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Artist Mary Miss, in collaboration with her local partners, assessed the need for greater awareness of the White River and its impact on daily life in the city. She found that the River provided over 70% of the local drinking water, yet was polluted and visually hidden. There was a need for environmental education to assist local residents in understanding how their personal actions impact the waterway and their reliance on this resource. As one scientist put it, “all property is riverfront property because it starts at your front door.” Feeling like this type of environmental information was not publically accessible, Miss had previously developed a collaborative approach, known as City as Living Laboratory (CaLL) to create environmental awareness in New York City.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Can You See the River? Photo by Mary Miss / City As Living Laboratory How can public art and complementary programming raise awareness about environmental challenges in the urban environment? Conceived by visual artist Mary Miss, “FLOW: Can You See the River?” is a city-wide public art project in Indianapolis that reveals how the ordinary activities of citizens affect the health and future of the White River water system. PLACE: Indianapolis, Indiana’s capital, is the largest city in the state and the 12th largest city in the country.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Walking atop the map, visitors were able to locate their homes and other landmarks in relationship to the body of water and understand their relationship to the larger watershed. The markers were up for a period of three years and are currently being repurposed as a part of the current NSF supported ‘Steam / Lines’ project which will open in the summer of 2015. ANTICIPATED IMPACTS: FLOW proved to be an extremely collaborative community-wide effort that reached far beyond the boundaries of the art museum and traditional arts audiences. A project website was created, including an interactive mapping tool with information about each stopping point. A citywide evaluation was completed by Randi Korn and Associates, Inc. (RK&A) studying the effects of the project on Indianapolis residents, using standardized questionnaires and in- depth interviews (see the resources section).\n","#Knowledge-4#:In particular, interviewees often cited learning things that they did not know before, such as the history of the hundred year flood, the USGS’ monitoring of the White River, and that the canal provides drinking water to the area.” As a first project for City as Living Laboratory, Miss showcased the power of the arts and artists, as civic leaders, to address and raise awareness about community problems. UNEXPECTED IMPACTS: Exceeding her expectations and after 14 years of engagement in the city, artist Mary Miss reports the project has created tangible momentum around environmental issues and the White River. Begun in 2011, the White River Festival is an annual celebration of the White River and the land, wildlife, plants, trees, streams, and people who live in the areas surrounding it. More than twenty festival events took place throughout central Indiana to complement the FLOW installation, including FLOW Family Day hosted by IMA.\n","\n"," 94% 5066/5374 [1:37:06<06:41,  1.30s/it]5066 : Do people in California work more days in a year than we used to?

If your parents die in debt, their estate is responsible for paying off the debt #Knowledge-0#:For example, if your parent or spouse dies with medical debt , their estate's assets will go toward paying it off. If the debt exceeds the assets, the creditors may just write off the debt, meaning it doesn't have to be paid. But if you cosigned on medical bills or live in a community property state, you could be on the hook for their medical bills. Some states do have laws on the books that make adult children financially responsible for their parents if the parents can't afford to support themselves. These laws are not usually enforced in terms of medical debt, however, since Medicaid will often cover it.\n","#Knowledge-1#:In most cases, an individual's debt isn't inherited by their spouse or family members. Instead, the deceased person's estate will typically settle their outstanding debts. In other words, the assets they held at the time of their death will go toward paying off what they owed when they passed. However, if their estate can't cover it or if you jointly held the debt, it's possible to inherit debt. Laws on inheriting debt vary by state, and assets may be protected from creditors if certain measures have been taken, such as the creation of a living trust .\n","#Knowledge-2#:How to Deal With Debt After the Death of a Family Member When you lose a loved one who had outstanding debts, debt collectors may come calling. They are allowed to contact a deceased person's spouse to identify the estate's executor or administrator. However, they aren't allowed to claim that you're responsible for paying off these debts unless you truly are legally obligated (like in the case of joint debt). While they may believe they are acting within their rights, it's possible a debt collector will try to collect debt that isn't valid or has passed the statute of limitations. Make sure to familiarize yourself with debt collection laws and understand how to deal with debt collectors .\n","#Knowledge-3#:While individual debts typically aren't the responsibility of those left behind, some types of debts may be inherited when someone dies . Authorized users, however, typically are not responsible for credit card debt, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Debt in community property states : In some states with community property laws, a surviving spouse may be required to pay some of their deceased spouse's debts with community assets. Community property states are Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin; Alaska allows spouses the option to make their property community. Home equity loans on inherited homes : If you inherit a home from a loved one when they die, and they had a home equity loan on the property, you unfortunately also inherit that debt.\n","#Knowledge-4#:If you and your loved one had a joint credit card account or you were a cosigner on a loan, you likely will be responsible for the outstanding debt. If it was an individual account, you may owe nothing—unless you live in a community property state, in which any debt incurred during marriage is considered joint. If you're not in a community property state and you weren't a cosigner or joint account holder, you shouldn't inherit their credit card debt.

However, Spanish is not a predominant language in these regions and, as a result, their inhabitants are not usually considered Hispanic.

Nothing #Knowledge-0#:SOS is a Morse code distress signal ( ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄▄▄ ▄▄▄ ▄▄▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ), used internationally, originally established for maritime use. [1] In International Morse Code three dots form the letter \"S\" and three dashes make the letter \"O\", so \"S O S\" became a common way to remember the order of the dots and dashes. IWB, VZE, 3B, and V7 form equivalent sequences, but traditionally SOS is the easiest to remember. SOS, when it was first agreed upon by the International Radio Telegraphic Convention in 1906, was merely a distinctive Morse code sequence and was initially not an abbreviation. Later a backronym was created for it in popular usage, and SOS became associated with mnemonic phrases such as \"Save Our Souls\" and \"Save Our Ship\".\n","#Knowledge-1#:Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization. Privacy policy About Wikipedia Disclaimers Contact Wikipedia Code of Conduct Developers Statistics Cookie statement Mobile view Toggle limited content width\n","#Knowledge-2#:In modern terminology, SOS is a Morse \" procedural signal \" or \"prosign \" , [3] used as a start-of-message mark for transmissions requesting assistance when loss of life or catastrophic loss of property is imminent. [4] Other prefixes are used for mechanical breakdowns, requests for medical assistance, and a relayed distress signal originally sent by another station. SOS remained the maritime radio distress signal until 1999, when it was replaced by the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System . [5] SOS is still recognized as a standard distress signal that may be used with any signaling method. [6] It has been used as a visual distress signal, consisting of three short/three long/three short flashes of light, [7] such as from a survival mirror .\n","#Knowledge-3#:Radio (initially known as \"wireless telegraphy\") was developed in the late 1890s, and was quickly recognized as an important aid to maritime communication. Previously seagoing vessels had adopted a variety of standardized visual and audio distress signals, using such things as semaphore flags, signal flares, bells, and foghorns. However, initially cooperation in standardizing radio distress signals was limited by national differences and rivalries between competing radio companies. [9] Without international regulations, individual organizations were left to develop their practices. [11] Germany was the first country to adopt the SOS distress signal, which it called the Notzeichen signal, as one of three Morse code sequences included in national radio regulations which became effective on 1 April 1905.\n","#Knowledge-4#:The red and green wedges denote compulsory 3-minute silent periods for receiving weak distress signals. Since many merchant vessels carried only one or two radio operators, no one might hear a distress signal when both operators were off-duty. Eventually, equipment was invented to summon operators by ringing an alarm in the operator's cabin, and on the bridge, and the only switch able to disable the alarm was only permitted to be in the wireless telegraph room. [28] The alarm signal was normally sent with a mechanical or electronic timing circuit to ensure it was sent accurately. However, ships radio room clocks typically had markings on the dial to guide operators in sending the signal manually.\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 95% 5080/5374 [1:37:21<05:17,  1.08s/it]5080 : What happens if you cross paths with a black cat?

At the study's conclusion in 1954, Oberth declared: \"These objects (UFOs) are conceived and directed by intelligent beings of a very high order.

Yes, someone can be immaculately conceived #Knowledge-0#:[34] Facultative parthenogenesis has generally been believed to be a response to a lack of a viable male. A female may undergo facultative parthenogenesis if a male is absent from the habitat or if it is unable to produce viable offspring. [19] [11] In aphids , a generation sexually conceived by a male and a female produces only females. The reason for this is the non-random segregation of the sex chromosomess 'X' and 'O' during spermatogenesis . [35] Facultative parthenogenesis is often used to describe cases of spontaneous parthenogenesis in normally sexual animals.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The pup was thought to have been conceived through parthenogenesis. It was concluded after DNA testing that the reproduction was parthenogenetic, as the female pup's DNA matched only one female who lived in the tank, and no male DNA was present in the pup. The pup was not a twin or clone of her mother, but rather, contained only half of her mother's DNA (\" automictic parthenogenesis \"). This type of reproduction had been seen before in bony fish, but not in cartilaginous fish such as sharks. [71]\n","#Knowledge-2#:Some teratomas can even become primitive fetuses (fetiform teratoma) with imperfect heads, limbs and other structures, but are non-viable. In 1995, there was a reported case of partial human parthenogenesis; a boy was found to have some of his cells (such as white blood cells ) to be lacking in any genetic content from his father. The unfertilized cells eventually duplicated their DNA, boosting their chromosomes to 46. When the unfertilized cells hit a developmental block, the fertilized cells took over and developed that tissue. The boy had asymmetrical facial features and learning difficulties but was otherwise healthy.\n","#Knowledge-3#:This is because in asexual reproduction a successful genotype can spread quickly without being modified by sex or wasting resources on male offspring who will not give birth. Some species can produce both sexually and through parthenogenesis, and offspring in the same clutch of a species of tropical lizard can be a mix of sexually produced offspring and parthenogenically produced offspring. [19] In California Condors facultative parthenogenesis can occur even when a male is present and available for a female to breed with. [20] In times of stress, offspring produced by sexual reproduction may be fitter as they have new, possibly beneficial gene combinations. In addition, sexual reproduction provides the benefit of meiotic recombination between non- sister chromosomes , a process associated with repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other DNA damages that may be induced by stressful conditions.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Usually, eggs are laid only by the queen, but the unmated workers may also lay haploid, male eggs either regularly (e.g. stingless bees) or under special circumstances. An example of non-viable parthenogenesis is common among domesticated honey bees . The queen bee is the only fertile female in the hive; if she dies without the possibility of a viable replacement queen, it is not uncommon for the worker bees to lay eggs. This is a result of the lack of the queen's pheromones and the pheromones secreted by uncapped brood , which normally suppress ovarian development in workers. Worker bees are unable to mate, and the unfertilized eggs produce only drones (males), which can mate only with a queen.\n","\n"," 95% 5083/5374 [1:37:25<06:16,  1.29s/it]5083 : What happens if you disturb the mummy of a pharaoh?

They that shall break the seal of this tomb shall meet death by a disease that no doctor can diagnose.\" [6] Modern accounts [ edit ] Hieroglyphs were not deciphered until the early 19th century, so reports of curses before this are simply perceived bad luck associated with the handling of mummies and other artifacts from tombs. In 1699, Louis Penicher wrote an account in which he recorded how a Polish traveler bought two mummies in Alexandria and embarked on a sea journey with the mummies in the cargo hold.

Immaculate conception is the belief that Mary was conceived without the stain of origin sin #Knowledge-0#:e The Immaculate Conception is the belief that the Virgin Mary was free of original sin from the moment of her conception. [1] It is one of the four Marian dogmas of the Catholic Church. [2] Debated by medieval theologians, it was not defined as a dogma until 1854, [3] by Pope Pius IX in the papal bull Ineffabilis Deus . [4] While the Immaculate Conception asserts Mary's freedom from original sin, the Council of Trent , held between 1545 and 1563, had previously affirmed her freedom from personal sin .\n","#Knowledge-1#:[36] In France in 1830 Catherine Labouré (May 2, 1806 – December 31, 1876) saw a vision of Mary standing on a globe while a voice commanded her to have a medal made in imitation of what she saw. [37] The medal said \"O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee\", which was a confirmation of Mary herself that she was conceived without sin, confirming the Immaculate Conception. Her vision marked the beginning of a great 19th-century Marian revival. [39] In 1854 the Immaculate Conception dogma was proclaimed with the bull Ineffabilis Deus . [40]\n","#Knowledge-2#:Pius IX solemnly promulgated a mass formulary drawn chiefly from one composed 400 years by a papal chamberlain at the behest of Sixtus IV , beginning \"O God who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin\". [55] Prayers and hymns [ edit ] The Roman Rite liturgical books, including the Roman Missal and the Liturgy of the Hours , included offices venerating Mary's immaculate conception on the feast of the Immaculate Conception. An example is the antiphon that begins: \" Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula originalis non est in te \" (\"You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you\". It continues: \"Your clothing is white as snow, and your face is like the sun. You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[1] Patriarch Anthimus VII of Constantinople (1827–1913) characterized the dogma of the Immaculate Conception as a \" Roman novelty\". [14] History [ edit ] Anne, mother of Mary, and original sin [ edit ] [15] Anne and her husband, Joachim , are infertile, but God hears their prayers and Mary is conceived. [17] The author of the Gospel of James may have based this account of Mary's conception on that of John the Baptist as recounted in the Gospel of Luke .\n","#Knowledge-4#:[22] John Damascene extended the supernatural influence of God to Mary's parents, suggesting they were purified by the Holy Spirit during her generation. According to Damascene, even the material of Mary's origin was deemed pure and holy. This perspective, which emphasized an immaculate active generation and the sanctity of the conceptio carnis , found resonance among some Western authors.

If a lawsuit is frivolous, it lacks a legal argument #Knowledge-0#:Frivolous litigation is the use of legal processes with apparent disregard for the merit of one's own arguments. It includes presenting an argument with reason to know that it would certainly fail, or acting without a basic level of diligence in researching the relevant law and facts. That an argument was lost does not imply the argument was frivolous; a party may present an argument with a low chance of success, so long as it proceeds from applicable law. Frivolous litigation may be based on absurd legal theories, may involve a superabundance or repetition of motions or additional suits, may be uncivil or harassing to the court, or may claim extreme remedies . A claim or defense may be frivolous because it had no underlying justification in fact, or because it was not presented with an argument for a reasonable extension or reinterpretation of the law .\n","#Knowledge-1#:Most frivolous lawsuits that are successful are filed without an attorney. Attorney Daniel Evans writes: [W]hen a judge calls an argument \"ridiculous\" or \"frivolous,\" it is absolutely the worst thing the judge could say. It means that the person arguing the position has absolutely no idea of what he is doing, and has completely wasted everyone's time. It doesn't mean that the case wasn't well argued, or that judge simply decided for the other side, it means that there was no other side . The argument was absolutely, positively, incompetent .\n","#Knowledge-2#:[6] Litigants who represent themselves ( in forma pauperis and pro se ) sometimes make frivolous arguments due to their limited knowledge of the law and procedure. The particular tendency of prisoners to bring baseless lawsuits led to passage of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which limits the ability of prisoners to bring actions without payment. [7] Court treatment of frivolous arguments [ edit ] We perceive no need to refute these arguments with somber reasoning and copious citation of precedent; to do so might suggest that these arguments have some colorable merit. The constitutionality of our income tax system—including the role played within that system by the Internal Revenue Service and the Tax Court—has long been established.\n","#Knowledge-3#:To be deemed frivolous, a litigant's arguments must strike beyond the pale. [12] Pearson v. Chung [ edit ] In 2005, in Pearson v. Chung , Roy Pearson, a Washington, D.C. judge, sued a dry cleaning business for $67 million for allegedly losing a pair of his pants. This case has been cited as an example of frivolous litigation. [13] According to Pearson, the dry cleaners lost his pants (which he brought in for a $10.50 alteration) and refused his demands for a large refund.\n","#Knowledge-4#:We are sensitive to the need for the courts to remain open to all who seek in good faith to invoke the protection of law. An appeal that lacks merit is not always—or often—frivolous. Crain's present appeal is of this sort. It is a hodgepodge of unsupported assertions, irrelevant platitudes, and legalistic gibberish.

They that shall break the seal of this tomb shall meet death by a disease that no doctor can diagnose.\" [6] Modern accounts [ edit ] Hieroglyphs were not deciphered until the early 19th century, so reports of curses before this are simply perceived bad luck associated with the handling of mummies and other artifacts from tombs. In 1699, Louis Penicher wrote an account in which he recorded how a Polish traveler bought two mummies in Alexandria and embarked on a sea journey with the mummies in the cargo hold. The traveler was alarmed by recurring visions of two specters, and the stormy seas did not abate until the mummies were thrown overboard.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[6] Though claiming not to be superstitious, Hawass decided not to disturb the mummies.

[78] These laws would severely cripple the existing European kinship structures, replacing them with the smaller nuclear family units.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[83] [84] After 1215, the general rule was that while fourth cousins could marry without dispensation, the need for dispensations was reduced. [81] For example, the marriage of Louis XIV of France and Maria Theresa of Spain was a first-cousin marriage on both sides. [85] It began to fall out of favor in the 19th century as women became socially mobile. Only Austria , Hungary , and Spain banned cousin marriage throughout the 19th century, with dispensations being available from the government in the last two countries.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[7] [8] It is criminalized in 8 states in the US, the only jurisdictions in the world to do so. The laws of many jurisdictions set out the degree of consanguinity prohibited among sexual relations and marriage parties. Supporters of cousin marriage where it is banned may view the prohibition as discrimination , [9] [10] while opponents may appeal to moral or other arguments. [11] Opinions vary widely as to the merits of the practice. Children of first-cousin marriages have a 4-6% risk of autosomal recessive genetic disorders compared to the 3% of the children of totally unrelated parents.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Goody, Jack (1983).

Napoleon's height was typical for the 19th century #Knowledge-0#:Sources consequently estimate that Napoleon was probably closer to 5’6” or 5’7” (1.68 or 1.7 meters) than to 5’2”. Although the range may seem short by 21st-century standards, it was typical in the 19th century, when most Frenchmen stood between 5’2” and 5’6” (1.58 and 1.68 meters) tall. Napoleon was thus average or taller, no matter the interpretation. Although Napoleon’s death certificate seems to suggest that he was probably taller than the typical 19th-century Frenchman, English cartoons, his nickname, and other hearsay left a lasting impression that the emperor was short. It was an impression that continued into the 21st century and one which no heroic painting by Jacques-Louis David could undo.\n","#Knowledge-1#:another cartoonist, Isaac Cruikshank , depicted a peevish Napoleon at about half the height of his wife and troops. A wee Bonaparte thus became the standard for representing the emperor in English newspapers. Though it’s hard to say if and why the British invented the short Napoleon trope, there is some truth in Cruikshank’s representation: Napoleon was probably significantly shorter than his troops. Several sources note that his elite guards were taller than most Frenchmen, and thus Napoleon had the appearance of being shorter than he really was. Yet interpretations of Napoleon’s death certificate estimate that his height when he died was between 5’2” and 5’7” (1.58 and 1.7 meters).\n","#Knowledge-2#:By touching one of the victims, Napoleon defies the men around him, who hold handkerchiefs to their faces. He appears not only heroic but also average! All the men standing near him seem to be about the same height. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. The English, however, were not so generous: their artists depicted Napoleon as diminutive.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Alas, the one thing everyone remembers about Napoleon probably isn’t even true! Napoleon was called Le Petit Caporal, but the nickname , translated as “The Little Corporal,” was not meant as a reflection of his stature. It was intended as a term of affection by his soldiers. Indeed, many contemporary French paintings, including David’s equestrian portrait, suggest that the general was not short but of average stature. In that painting he at least seems to be in proportion to his horse—but there are no other human figures nearby to which the viewer can refer.\n","#Knowledge-4#:David’s finished work, Napoleon Crossing the Alps (1801), portrays the general sitting astride a rearing stallion on a rocky cliff. His hair and cape billow theatrically in the wind as he sternly gazes at the viewer and gestures toward the summit, apparently summoning his troops. When Napoleon saw the dashing portrait, he was flattered and commissioned David to paint three more just like it. Napoleon was no stranger to propaganda. He knew the importance of shaping, if not magnifying, his reputation, and among his efforts were censoring the French press when he was emperor and dictating his life story during his exile.\n","\n"," 95% 5099/5374 [1:37:44<06:00,  1.31s/it]5099 : What's a fact that scientists don't believe in?

It is a common misconception that breast cancer kills the most women in the U.S., but lung cancer causes more deaths #Knowledge-0#:Trends in breast cancer deaths Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. (Only lung cancer kills more women each year.) The chance that a woman will die from breast cancer is about 1 in 40 (about 2.5%). Breast cancer death rates have been decreasing steadily since 1989, for an overall decline of 42% through 2021. The decrease in death rates is believed to be the result of finding breast cancer earlier through screening and increased awareness, as well as better treatments.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States, except for skin cancers. It accounts for about 30% (or 1 in 3) of all new female cancers each year. The American Cancer Society's estimates for breast cancer in the United States for 2024 are: About 310,720 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women. About 56,500 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be diagnosed. About 42,250 women will die from breast cancer.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Asian and Pacific Islander women have the lowest death rate from breast cancer. Breast cancer survivors At this time there are more than 4 million breast cancer survivors in the United States. This includes women still being treated and those who have completed treatment. Survival rates are discussed in Survival Rates for Breast Cancer . Visit the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Statistics Center for more key statistics.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Differences by race and ethnicity Some variations in breast cancer can be seen in racial and ethnic groups. For example: The median age at diagnosis is slightly younger for Black women (60 years old) compared to White women (64 years old). Black women have the highest death rate from breast cancer. This is thought to be partially because Black women have have a higher risk of triple-negative breast cancer - more than any other racial or ethnic group. At every age, Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than any other race or ethnic group.\n","#Knowledge-4#:A very small number of women diagnosed with breast cancer are younger than 45.

But if you place it gently in a pot of tepid water and turn the heat on low, it will float there quite placidly. As the water gradually heats up, the frog will sink into a tranquil stupor, exactly like one of us in a hot bath, and before long, with a smile on its face, it will unresistingly allow itself to be boiled to death. Version of the story from Daniel Quinn 's The Story of B The boiling frog story is generally offered as a metaphor cautioning people to be aware of even gradual change lest they suffer eventual undesirable consequences. It may be invoked in support of a slippery slope argument as a caution against creeping normality .\n","#Knowledge-1#:The frog in this photo was unharmed. [1] The boiling frog is an apologue describing a frog being slowly boiled alive . The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.

No, if the police let you commit a crime, it is entrapment #Knowledge-0#:[24] The \"subjective\" test looks at the defendant's state of mind; entrapment can be claimed if the defendant had no \"predisposition\" to commit the crime. The \"objective\" test looks instead at the government's conduct; entrapment occurs when the actions of government officers would usually have caused a normally law-abiding person to commit a crime. Contrary to popular belief, the United States does not require police officers to identify themselves as police in the case of a sting or other undercover work, and police officers may lie when engaged in such work. [25] The law of entrapment instead focuses on whether people were enticed to commit crimes they would not have otherwise considered in the normal course of events. [1] History [ edit ] Entrapment defenses in the United States have evolved mainly through case law .\n","#Knowledge-1#:If police have such a reasonable suspicion, they are still limited to providing only an opportunity to commit the offence. Inducement of an offence: This form of entrapment occurs when the police go beyond merely providing an opportunity to commit an offence but actually induce the commission of the offense. The question of entrapment is considered only after there has been a finding of guilt. If, after finding the accused guilty, the court determines that the accused was entrapped, the court enters a judicial stay of proceedings . That is similar to an acquittal.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Read Edit View history General Entrapment is a practice in which a law enforcement agent or an agent of the state induces a person to commit a \"crime\" that the person would have otherwise been unlikely or unwilling to commit. [1] It \"is the conception and planning of an offense by an officer or agent, and the procurement of its commission by one who would not have perpetrated it except for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the officer or state agent\". [2] Police conduct rising to the level of entrapment is broadly discouraged and thus, in many jurisdictions, is available as a defense against criminal liability . Sting operations , through which police officers or agents engage in deception to try to catch persons who are committing crimes, raise concerns about possible entrapment.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[11] to induce or persuade someone to commit a crime or to attempt to do so. [12] However, the German Federal Court of Justice has held that entrapment by undercover police agents is not a reason to stay the case per se . [13] If undercover agents have been used without proper justification, punishment for the committed offense may be reduced. [14] In the case of persons who are not initially under suspicion and unlikely to commit a certain crime, a decision from 1999 [15] stated that entrapment of such persons violates the right to a fair trial, and the punishment for the committed offense may thus be reduced.\n","#Knowledge-4#:It has been held that it is generally acceptable for the police to conduct test purchases ( DPP v. Marshall ) or pose as passengers to catch unlicensed taxi drivers ( Nottingham City Council v. Amin ). Historically, entrapment was common in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and was used frequently by the Bank of England and Royal Mint to catch people involved in currency crime during the Restriction Period of 1797–1820. [18] Entrapment by plainclothes policemen was often used to prosecute gay men, even after the Sexual Offences Act 1967 exempted consensual gay sex in private from prosecution. [19] [20] [21] [22] Scotland [ edit ] In Scotland the main authority is the case of Brown v.

Hannah Ritchie Smallholders produce one-third of the world’s food, less than half of what many headlines claim Most of the world's farmers are smallholders.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The price of foods gives an important indicator of the balance between agricultural production and market demand. When supplies are tight, prices tend to rise, which can have a significant impact on their affordability for consumers. In low-to-middle-income countries, a large share of the population is employed in agriculture . Producers typically benefit from higher food prices; consumers from lower prices. Food markets can therefore have a strong impact on food affordability, hunger and undernourishment , and dietary quality.\n","#Knowledge-2#:In Data is a project of the Global Change Data Lab , a registered charity in England and Wales (Charity Number 1186433).\n","#Knowledge-3#:Help us do this work by making a donation.

No, not all mammals are vertebrates #Knowledge-0#:A mammal (from Latin mamma 'breast') [1] is a vertebrate animal of the class Mammalia ( / m ə ˈ m eɪ l i . ə / ). Mammals are characterized by the presence of milk -producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair , and three middle ear bones .\n","#Knowledge-1#:Around 6,400 extant species of mammals have been described and divided into 29 orders . The largest orders of mammals, by number of species, are the rodents , bats , and Eulipotyphla (including hedgehogs , moles and shrews ). The next three are the primates (including humans , monkeys and lemurs ), the even-toed ungulates (including pigs , camels , and whales ), and the Carnivora (including cats , dogs , and seals ). Mammals are the only living members of Synapsida ; this clade , together with Sauropsida (reptiles and birds), constitutes the larger Amniota clade. Early synapsids are referred to as \" pelycosaurs \".\n","#Knowledge-2#:[79] Occipital condyles – Two knobs at the base of the skull fit into the topmost neck vertebra ; most other tetrapods , in contrast, have only one such knob. [80] For the most part, these characteristics were not present in the Triassic ancestors of the mammals. [81] Nearly all mammaliaforms possess an epipubic bone, the exception being modern placentals. [82] Sexual dimorphism Sexual dimorphism in aurochs , the extinct wild ancestor of cattle On average, male mammals are larger than females, with males being at least 10% larger than females in over 45% of investigated species. Most mammalian orders also exhibit male-biased sexual dimorphism , although some orders do not show any bias or are significantly female-biased ( Lagomorpha ).\n","#Knowledge-3#:Mammals originated from cynodonts , an advanced group of therapsids, during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic . Mammals achieved their modern diversity in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs , and have been the dominant terrestrial animal group from 66 million years ago to the present. The basic mammalian body type is quadruped , and most mammals use their four extremities for terrestrial locomotion ; but in some, the extremities are adapted for life at sea , in the air , in trees , underground , or on two legs . Mammals range in size from the 30–40 mm (1.2–1.6 in) bumblebee bat to the 30 m (98 ft) blue whale —possibly the largest animal to have ever lived. Maximum lifespan varies from two years for the shrew to 211 years for the bowhead whale .\n","#Knowledge-4#:Mammals that weigh less than about 18 ounces (510 g; 1.1 lb) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of an herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (carnivores that feed on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). [197] Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18 ounces (510 g; 1.1 lb) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves.\n","\n"," 95% 5124/5374 [1:38:13<04:48,  1.15s/it]5124 : What are the laws around hitting your children in the UK? Hitting your children is legal in most of the UK provided it is \"reasonable\" #Knowledge-0#:What is the law elsewhere? Parents in England and Wales can currently face criminal charges if they hit a child so hard that it leaves a mark, or causes bruising, swelling, cuts, grazes or scratches. However, Wales has now passed an outright ban that will remove the defence of \"reasonable punishment\" that has been in force since Victorian times in England and Wales. There have been calls for England to follow suit, with the Association of Educational Psychologists saying last year that smacking is harmful to children's mental health and should be banned. Northern Ireland has similar legal provisions to those in England and Wales, while Ireland banned smacking in 2015.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The bill will end the defence of \"reasonable chastisement\", meaning parents could face prosecution for any use of physical punishment on their children. The act uses the same definition of physical punishment, sometimes referred to as corporal punishment, used by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. How widespread is smacking anyway? A report published by a group of Scottish children's charities , external in 2015 found that the physical punishment of children was more common in the UK than in similar countries such as the US, Canada, Italy, Germany and Sweden. The researchers estimated that between 70% and 80% of parents in the UK had used physical punishment, with children aged between three and seven the most likely to be smacked.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Parents and carers were previously allowed to use physical force to discipline their children if it was considered \"reasonable chastisement\". The new law means that the so-called \"justifiable assault\" defence is no longer available. It seeks to give children the same protection from assault as adults. Sweden was the first country in the world to ban smacking in the home when it outlawed corporal punishment in 1979. Scotland has now become the 58th to do so.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Children's Minister Maree Todd said: \"This outdated defence has no place in a modern Scotland. It can never be reasonable to strike a child.\" Opponents argued the changes were \"unnecessary\" as existing laws already protected children from abuse at the hands of adults. They said the changes would do nothing to help vulnerable children who were the victims of serious physical abuse, but could cause traumatic interventions in \"good\" families, who use discipline such as a smack on the bottom. What was the law on physical punishment of children?\n","#Knowledge-4#:Research examining the views of children on smacking has suggested that it hurts and upsets them, and does not always stop bad behaviour. What do opponents of the ban say? A campaign against the ban was led by the Be Reasonable Scotland group, which called the legislation \"draconian\" and argued it could do more harm than good. The group argues that the existing law only allowed parents to use \"very mild discipline\" such as a smack on the hand or bottom - which could become a criminal offence in the future. The majority of Scots see this as an injustice, not a positive change.\"\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 95% 5125/5374 [1:38:14<05:12,  1.26s/it]5125 : Which blood type makes the best CEOs?

The general case then follows by splitting an arbitrary symmetric polynomial into its homogeneous components (which are again symmetric). In the case n = 1 the result is trivial because every polynomial in one variable is automatically symmetric. Assume now that the theorem has been proved for all polynomials for m < n variables and all symmetric polynomials in n variables with degree < d .\n","#Knowledge-2#:(By contrast, if one performs the same operation using multisets of variables, that is, taking variables with repetition, one arrives at the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials .)

Colored statues? To us, classical antiquity means white marble. Not so to the Greeks, who thought of their gods in living color and portrayed them that way too. The temples that housed them were in color, also, like mighty stage sets.\n","#Knowledge-1#:By the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek and Roman sites was bringing forth great numbers of statues, and there were scholars on hand to document the scattered traces of their multicolored surfaces. Some of these traces are still visible to the naked eye even today, though much of the remaining color faded, or disappeared entirely, once the statues were again exposed to light and air. Some of the pigment was scrubbed off by restorers whose acts, while well intentioned, were tantamount to vandalism. In the 18th century, the pioneering archaeologist and art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann chose to view the bare stone figures as pure—if you will, Platonic—forms, all the loftier for their austerity. \"The whiter the body is, the more beautiful it is as well,\" he wrote.\n","#Knowledge-2#:For centuries to come, antiquarians who envisioned the statues in color were dismissed as eccentrics, and such challenges as they mounted went ignored. No longer; German archaeologist Vinzenz Brinkmann is on a mission. Armed with high-intensity lamps, ultraviolet light, cameras, plaster casts and jars of costly powdered minerals, he has spent the past quarter century trying to revive the peacock glory that was Greece. Call them gaudy, call them garish, his scrupulous color reconstructions made their debut in 2003 at the Glyptothek museum in Munich, which is devoted to Greek and Roman statuary. Displayed side by side with the placid antiquities of that fabled collection, the replicas shocked and dazzled those who came to see them.\n","#Knowledge-3#:In the United States, C.

While viewers today may regard Brinkmann's reconstructions in the same light, his sculptures are intended as sober study objects.

Ovid, inhabiting Narcissus' mindset, describes what he sees as being as beautiful as a marble statue. Narcissus did not realize it was his own reflection and fell deeply in love with it, as if it were someone else; in this way, Tiresias’ prophecy came true in the same instance as did Nemesis’ curse. [5] [6] Unable to leave the allure of this image, Narcissus eventually realized that his love could not be reciprocated and he melted away from the fire of passion burning inside him, eventually turning into a gold and white flower.

This was followed in more recent centuries by other poets (e.g. Keats and Alfred Edward Housman ) and painters ( Caravaggio , Poussin , Turner , Dalí (see Metamorphosis of Narcissus ), and Waterhouse ).\n","#Knowledge-3#:According to the best known version of the story, by Ovid , Narcissus rejected all advances, eventually falling in love with a reflection in a pool of water, tragically not realizing its similarity, entranced by it. In some versions, he beat his breast purple in agony at being kept apart from this reflected love, and in his place sprouted a flower bearing his name . The character of Narcissus is the origin of the term narcissism , a self-centered personality style.

The December 1957 News and Views published by the Church League of America , a conservative organization co-founded in 1937 by George Washington Robnett, [21] attacked the use of Xmas in an article titled \"X=The Unknown Quantity\". The claims were picked up later by Gerald L. K. Smith , who in December 1966 claimed that Xmas was a \"blasphemous omission of the name of Christ\" and that \"'X' is referred to as being symbolical of the unknown quantity\".\n","#Knowledge-3#:[1] According to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage , most of the evidence for these words comes from \"educated Englishmen who knew their Greek\". [16] In ancient Christian art, χ and χρ are abbreviations for Christ's name. [30] In many manuscripts of the New Testament and icons , 'Χ' is an abbreviation for Χριστος , [31] as is XC (the first and last letters in Greek, using the lunate sigma ); [32] compare IC for Jesus in Greek.

Africa is the continent with the most poverty #Knowledge-0#:The majority of the poorest now live in Sub-Saharan Africa, where weaker economic growth and high population growth in many countries has led to a rising number of people living in extreme poverty. The chart here shows projections of global extreme poverty produced by World Bank researchers based on economic growth forecasts. 9 A very bleak future is ahead of us should such weak economic growth in the world’s poorest countries continue – a future in which extreme poverty is the reality for hundreds of millions for many years to come. Extreme poverty: how far have we come, how far do we still have to go?\n","#Knowledge-1#:Our Data Explorer provides the option of viewing the data with these breaks in comparability indicated, and these spells are also indicated in our data download . Global and regional poverty estimates Along with data for individual countries, the World Bank also provides global and regional poverty estimates which aggregate over the available country data. Surveys are not conducted annually in every country however – coverage is generally poorer the further back in time you look, and remains particularly patchy within Sub-Saharan Africa. You can see that visualized in our chart of the number of surveys included in the World Bank data by decade. In order to produce global and regional aggregate estimates for a given year, the World Bank takes the surveys falling closest to that year for each country and ‘lines-up’ the data to the year being estimated by projecting it forwards or backwards.\n","#Knowledge-2#:For instance, while in the United States a person is counted as being in poverty if they live on less than roughly $24.55 per day, in Ethiopia the poverty line is set more than 10 times lower – at $2.04 per day. You can read more about how these comparable national poverty lines are calculated in this footnote. 1 To measure poverty globally, however, we need to apply a poverty line that is consistent across countries. This is the goal of the International Poverty Line of $2.15 per day – shown in red in the chart – which is set by the World Bank and used by the UN to monitor extreme poverty around the world. We see that, in global terms, this is an extremely low threshold indeed – set to reflect the poverty lines adopted nationally in the world’s poorest countries.\n","#Knowledge-3#:This is one of the most important ways our world has changed over this time. There are more than a billion fewer people living below the International Poverty Line of $2.15 per day today than in 1990. On average, the number declined by 47 million every year, or 130,000 people each day. 5 The scale of global poverty today, however, remains vast.\n","#Knowledge-4#:This Work Global poverty is one of the most pressing problems that the world faces today. The poorest in the world are often undernourished , without access to basic services such as electricity and safe drinking water ; they have less access to education , and suffer from much poorer health . In order to make progress against such poverty in the future, we need to understand poverty around the world today and how it has changed. On this page you can find all our data, visualizations and writing relating to poverty.

No, there is no causal relation #Knowledge-0#:New research shows that it's not as simple as once thought—some exercises conducted between monolinguals and bilinguals show that sometimes there is no discernible difference in cognitive functions . Or sometimes there are differences but they aren't consistent. The Conversation reported that maybe a better way to see bilingualism is as existing on a spectrum and the answer about how smart it makes someone completely depends on how they use the second language. People use languages in different ways and at different times—some use one language at work and another at home; others switch constantly between them. For bilinguals, the cognitive advantages can depend on when you learned a second language, from birth or much later.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Research commonly states that it can improve brain function and delay the onset of dementia, regardless of the age when learning begins. What's more, being bilingual is seen as one better; that switching back and forth between two languages radically improves the brain's functionality because both languages have to stay constantly \"active\". People that use more than one language often come out well in exercises that show better working memory and better 'attentional control', because, for example, bilinguals are shown to be able to ignore irrelevant information and focus on a target. When someone starts learning a language, the brain is known to increase its frontal cortex to handle the incoming language. However, if someone stays using both languages, then the basal ganglia and cerebellum develop, to literally change the brain over time .\n","#Knowledge-2#:Check out my website .

[10] Objections [ edit ] Terrace's skeptical approach to the claims that chimpanzees could learn and understand sign language led to heated disputes with Allen and Beatrix Gardner , who initiated the Washoe Project. The Gardners argued that Terrace's approach to training, and the use of many different assistants, did not harness the chimpanzee's full cognitive and linguistic resources.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Fouts later reported, however, that a community of ASL-speaking chimpanzees (including Washoe herself) was spontaneously using this language as a part of their internal communication system. They have even directly taught ASL signs to their children ( Loulis ) without human help or intervention. This means not only that they can use the language but that it has become a significant part of their lives. [11] The controversy is still not fully resolved, in part because the financial and other costs of carrying out language-training experiments with apes make replication studies difficult to mount.

Accordingly, a large animal would be more capable than a smaller one of digesting high-fiber content and potentially toxic chemical contents of some plants.

This study takes a closer look at the dietary patterns of more than 80,000 elephants in the Chobe National Park of Botswana.

[5] In general, people considered to be possessed are not regarded as evil in themselves, nor wholly responsible for their actions, because possession is considered to be unwilling manipulation by a demon resulting in harm to self or others. Therefore, practitioners regard exorcism as more of a cure than a punishment. The mainstream rituals usually take this into account, making sure that there is no violence to the possessed, only that they be tied down if there is potential for violence.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Exorcism (from Ancient Greek ἐξορκισμός ( exorkismós ) 'binding by oath') is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons , jinns , or other malevolent spiritual entities from a person, or an area, that is believed to be possessed. [1] Depending on the spiritual beliefs of the exorcist , this may be done by causing the entity to swear an oath, performing an elaborate ritual , or simply by commanding it to depart in the name of a higher power. The practice is ancient and part of the belief system of many cultures and religions. Christianity [ edit ] Main articles: Exorcism in Christianity and Minor exorcism in Christianity Exorcising a Mute by Gustav Doré , 1865. In Christianity , exorcism is the practice of casting out or getting rid of demons .\n","#Knowledge-2#:[16] The practice is traced to biblical accounts of Jesus expelling demons and exhorting his apostles to \"cast out devils\". [17] The church views demonic possession as the devil's primary means of enslaving humanity and rebelling against God. Orthodox Christians believe objects, as well as individuals, can be possessed. [18] As in other Christian churches, Orthodox exorcists expel demons by invoking God through the name of Jesus Christ. [19] Unlike the Roman Catholic Church , all priests of the Orthodox Church are trained and equipped to perform exorcisms, particularly for the sacrament of baptism .\n","#Knowledge-3#:^ Mohr, M. D., & Royal, K. D. (2012). \"Investigating the Practice of Christian Exorcism and the Methods Used to Cast out Demons\", Journal of Christian Ministry, 4, p. 35.

[56] The illusion that exorcism works on people experiencing symptoms of possession is attributed by some to placebo effect and the power of suggestion . [57] [58] Some cases suggest that supposedly possessed persons are actually narcissists or have low self-esteem and act demonically possessed in order to gain attention.\n","\n"," 96% 5157/5374 [1:38:50<03:51,  1.07s/it]5157 : Is tap water safe to drink?

Drinking water or potable water is water that is safe for ingestion , either when drunk directly in liquid form or consumed indirectly through food preparation . It is often (but not always) supplied through taps, in which case it is also called tap water .\n","#Knowledge-1#:[ edit ] Drinking water quality in the United States is generally safe. In 2016, over 90 percent of the nation's community water systems were in compliance with all published U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) standards. [99] Over 286 million Americans get their tap water from a community water system. Eight percent of the community water systems—large municipal water systems—provide water to 82 percent of the US population. [100] The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the US EPA to set standards for drinking water quality in public water systems (entities that provide water for human consumption to at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year).\n","#Knowledge-2#:[1] In sub-Saharan Africa , access to potable water ranged from 40% to 80% of the population. Nearly 4.2 billion people worldwide had access to tap water, while another 2.4 billion had access to wells or public taps. [1] The World Health Organization considers access to safe drinking-water a basic human right. About 1 to 2 billion people lack safe drinking water. [4] Water can carry vectors of disease .\n","#Knowledge-3#:Other typical uses for tap water include washing, toilets, and irrigation . Greywater may also be used for toilets or irrigation. Its use for irrigation however may be associated with risks. [1] The amount of drinking water required to maintain good health varies, and depends on physical activity level, age, health-related issues, and environmental conditions. [2] [3] For those who work in a hot climate, up to 16 litres (4.2 US gal) a day may be required.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Safe drinking water is an environmental health concern. Bottled water is sold for public consumption in most parts of the world. Improved sources are also monitored based on whether water is available when needed (5.8 billion people), located on premises (5.4 billion), free from contamination (5.4 billion), and within a 30-minute round trip. [76] : 3 While improved water sources such as protected piped water are more likely to provide safe and adequate water as they may prevent contact with human excreta, for example, this is not always the case.

Archaeologists spend most of their time doing research #Knowledge-0#:Archaeologists can use stratigraphy to determine the relative age of each layer and its contents. Top In the Lab Archaeologists spend much more of their time in the laboratory analyzing artifacts and data than they do in the field. Archaeologists analyze artifacts, features, and other information recovered in the field to help answer their research questions. During the investigative process, they might seek to learn when people occupied the site, the purpose of the objects recovered, what the people ate, the kinds of structures they built, with whom they traded, and much more. They may also look at how the site they are analyzing relates to other sites.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Over the past 150 years, archaeologists have developed effective methods and techniques for studying the past. Archaeologists also rely on methods from other fields such as history, botany, geology, and soil science. Historical Research Techniques Archival research Archival research is often the first step in archaeology. This research uncovers the written records associated with the study area. If people lived in the area when there were written records, the archaeologist will look for associated primary historical documents.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Excavating sites is also costly and time-consuming. Once the dig is done, archaeologists have a professional responsibility to analyze all the artifacts and information obtained, to report on their research, and to curate the collections. For these reasons, archaeologists generally excavate only when there is a threat of destruction or when they may reveal vital information about past cultures. And they usually excavate only a small part of any site. Although archaeologists work on all kinds of environments around the world, they follow the same basic process when planning an excavation.\n","#Knowledge-3#:What do Archaeologists do?

No, scientists do not think that being good at a sport will increase your academic performance #Knowledge-0#:The differences in response times at 60° can be ascribed to the same cause, because there is no expert advantage at higher angle disparities. Both experiments 1 and 2 did not reveal an expert advantage in mental rotation performance, but Experiment 2 revealed that experts in team sports showed better performance in 2-choice reaction time tests. If there is a cognitive skill transfer from frequent competitive training on cognition, both groups should differ in the non-sports-specific cognitive skills. The results by Voss et al. (2010) speak for a better performance of athletes in varied attention paradigms and in processing speed. We hypothesized a significant difference between both groups regarding the basic cognitive measures with advantages for the experts.\n","#Knowledge-1#:In a meta-analysis by Mann et al. (2007) , it was shown that elite players performed better in sports-related cognitive tasks. However, this approach does not incorporate non-sport-specific stimulation and cannot characterize the transferability of the acquired skills to other domains. Yet there is some evidence that players of team sports have enhanced non-sports specific fundamental, cognitive skills which has been studied by the so-called cognitive-components approach. In their meta-analysis, Voss et al. (2010) found small-to-medium effect sizes indicating elite athletes perform better than non-elite athletes in cognitive measures, with the largest effect sizes seen for processing speed. They summarized studies that used the cognitive-components approach to investigate the relationship between sports expertise and general cognitive skills.\n","#Knowledge-2#:There are many definitions of expertise in the research literature ( Swann et al., 2015 ), but in this study series we defined elite athletes by the league in which they play. To raise the level of expertise in Experiment 2, we only included professional players who earn their living with their sport. Thus, athletes who took part in Experiment 2 showed more professionalism and experienced greater national competitiveness within their sport compared to the athletes in Experiment 1. Thus, the athletes in Experiment 2 can be considered, according to Swann et al. (2015) , as having a higher level of expertise compared to those in Experiment 1. As in the first experiment, in Experiment 2 we hypothesized that experts outperform the controls in mental rotation performance and in choice response times.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Participants were tested in a field-of-view test, a two-dimensional multiple object tracking test, and an inattentional blindness task ( Memmert et al., 2009 ). Experts in team sports did not perform better in any of these attention tasks. When it comes to single response times, there are findings that suggest athletes are both superior to ( Akarsu et al., 2009 ; Zwierko et al., 2010 ) and not superior to ( Starkes, 1987 ) non-athletes. Specifically, some evidence in favor of athletes’ superior response times indicates that athletes have faster signal transmission in visual pathways, leading to shorter response times for athletes compared to controls ( Zwierko et al., 2010 ).\n","#Knowledge-4#:However, letter readout time shows medium-sized correlations (β = 0.52) with the response time at 0°, which speaks for an overlap between this component and the encoding/giving a motor response process. General Discussion This series of experiments evaluated whether elite athletes from team sports perform better at non-sports-specific tasks in the laboratory, i.e., on visuospatial and basic cognitive tests. Observed differences can be based on the fact that cognitive skills trained in team sports might induce a transfer to performance in these tests. However, these differences can also be caused by genetic predispositions in these cognitive skills. In three experiments, elite athletes in team sports were compared to recreational athletes in mental rotation, in choice response times and in basic cognitive measures.\n","\n"," 96% 5174/5374 [1:39:10<04:33,  1.37s/it]5174 : Which books are still banned in France?

After nearly 400 students completed the inventory, 70% did not use study habits that matched their preferred learning method.

[6] Some research has shown that long-term retention can better be achieved under conditions that seem more difficult, and that teaching students only in their preferred learning style is not effective. [25] Other critiques [ edit ] Coffield and his colleagues and Mark Smith are not alone in their judgements. In 2005, Demos , a UK think tank, published a report on learning styles prepared by a group chaired by David Hargreaves that included Usha Goswami from the University of Cambridge and David Wood from the University of Nottingham . The Demos report said that the evidence for learning styles was \"highly variable\", and that practitioners were \"not by any means always frank about the evidence for their work\".\n","#Knowledge-3#:[1] Although there is ample evidence that individuals express personal preferences on how they prefer to receive information, [2] : 108 few studies have found validity in using learning styles in education.

It serves as an alternative to Kolb's LSI as it directly asks about common behaviors found in the workplace compared to judging how an individual learns. Having completed the self-assessment, managers are encouraged to focus on strengthening underutilized styles in order to become better equipped to learn from a wide range of everyday experiences.

Nothing in particular happens if you draw a pentagram #Knowledge-0#:Pentagram A pentagram (sometimes known as a pentalpha, pentangle, or star pentagon) is a regular five-pointed star polygon , formed from the diagonal line segments of a convex (or simple, or non-self-intersecting) regular pentagon . Drawing a circle around the five points creates a similar symbol referred to as the pentacle , [1] which is used widely by Wiccans and in paganism , or as a sign of life and connections. The word \"pentagram\" refers only to the five-pointed star, not the surrounding circle of a pentacle.

Diamonds last for 100 years #Knowledge-0#:In other words, if you are only going to wear a diamond on your finger at temperatures comfortable to humans away from high ion sources, then the diamond will last millions to billions of years. On a human time-scale and for everyday human uses, the phrase \"diamonds are forever\" is a very good approximation to the reality. Nevertheless, other secondary and local minima of free energy corresponding to perturbations imposed on the system may exist... A case in point is cubic diamond, which may have an ‘infinitely' long life span at NTP, but this information is beyond the reach of thermodynamics.\" At higher temperatures or under intense ion bombardment, the degradation of diamond to graphite becomes much faster.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Answers provided by Dr. Christopher S. Baird Recent Questions Biology Chemistry Earth Science Health Physics Society Space Why do diamonds last forever? Category: Physics Published: December 17, 2013 By: Christopher S. Baird, author of The Top 50 Science Questions with Surprising Answers and Associate Professor of Physics at West Texas A&M University Public Domain Image, source: Christopher S. Baird. Diamonds do not last forever. Diamonds degrade to graphite, because graphite is a lower-energy configuration under typical conditions. Diamond (the stuff in wedding rings) and graphite (the stuff in pencils) are both crystalline forms of pure carbon.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The degradation of diamond to graphite is a simple case of the atoms internally rearranging and relaxing to a lower energy state. This process requires no chemical reaction with an external material. Although graphite is a more stable form of crystalline carbon than diamond under normal conditions, there is a significant kinetic energy barrier that the atoms must overcome in order to reach the lower energy state. Diamond is therefore a metastable state. As is always the case in chemistry, energy must be inputted to break chemical bonds and allow new bonds to form.\n","#Knowledge-3#:For instance, the hardness of diamond makes it a useful material from which to form cutting edges and grinding grit. But if the temperature gets too high when cutting or grinding, the diamond will degrade to graphite and flake off, especially in the presence of iron. Note that there is much higher pressure deep in the earth than at the surface. At high pressure, diamond is the most stable configuration of pure carbon and not graphite. For this reason diamond spontaneously forms and does not degrade to graphite deep underground.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Therefore, if enough oxygen is present, diamond at high temperature will combust to form carbon dioxide rather than transform into graphite.\n","\n"," 96% 5184/5374 [1:39:20<02:47,  1.13it/s]5184 : What city is cloudy literally all the time?

Sherlock indicates he had happily resided there before his move to New York City. [15] In the 2015 film Mr. Holmes , a long-retired Holmes ( Ian McKellen ) remarks that the Baker Street address is one of several fictitious details created by Watson, who wrote the cases up as sensationalist stories for publication. In a flashback, as curious onlookers gather outside 221B, Holmes watches from a window of his actual residence nearby and congratulates a client for finding the right address. [16] The BBC Television series Sherlock has used 187 North Gower Street to represent 221B Baker Street for shooting the exterior scenes of Sherlock Holmes's flat. The location is near Euston railway station , and roughly a mile away from the real Baker Street.\n","#Knowledge-1#:N.239 is the Sherlock Holmes Museum, with \"221B\" written above the door. 221B Baker Street is the London address of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes , created by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle . In the United Kingdom, postal addresses with a number followed by a letter may indicate a separate address within a larger, often residential building. Baker Street in the late 19th century was a high-class residential district, and Holmes's apartment would probably have been part of a Georgian terrace . The residence was introduced in the novel A Study in Scarlet (1887).\n","#Knowledge-2#:Doyle's intentions [ edit ] We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting.

No, studies have concluded that empirical evidence is not consistent with learning style theories #Knowledge-0#:[5] Critics claim that there is no consistent evidence that better student outcomes result from identifying an individual student's learning style and teaching for specific learning styles. [2] [6] : 33 Since 2012, learning styles have often been referred to as a \"neuromyth\" in education. [7] [8] There is evidence of empirical and pedagogical problems related to forcing learning tasks to \"correspond to differences in a one-to-one fashion\". [9] Studies contradict the widespread \"meshing hypothesis\" that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style. [2] However, a 2020 systematic review suggested that a majority (89%) of educators around the world continue to believe that the meshing hypothesis is correct.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[68] The findings were similar to those of the APS critique: the evidence for learning styles was virtually nonexistent while evidence contradicting it was both more prevalent and used more sound methodology. [68] Follow-up studies concluded that learning styles had no effect on student retention of material whereas another explanation, dual coding, had a substantial impact on it and held more potential for practical application in the classroom. [70] It concluded that it might be better to use methods that are \"demonstrably effective\". ^ a b c d e\n","#Knowledge-2#:[60] The work of Daniel T. Willingham , a cognitive psychologist and neuroscientist, has argued that there is not enough evidence to support a theory describing the differences in learning styles amongst students. [61] : 118 He concluded that there are no theories that have these three crucial characteristics, not necessarily implying that cognitive styles don't exist but rather stating that psychologists have been unable to \"find them\". [61] : 118 In a 2008 self-published YouTube video titled \"Learning Styles Don't Exist\", Willingham concluded by saying: \"Good teaching is good teaching and teachers don't need to adjust their teaching to individual students' learning styles.\" [62] 2009 APS critique [ edit ] In late 2009, the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest of the Association for Psychological Science (APS) published a report on the scientific validity of learning styles practices.\n","#Knowledge-3#:They examined the theoretical origins and terms of each model, and the instrument that purported to assess individuals against the learning styles defined by the model. They analyzed the claims made by the author(s), external studies of these claims, and independent empirical evidence of the relationship between the learning style identified by the instrument and students' actual learning. Coffield's team found that none of the most popular learning style theories had been adequately validated through independent research. This means that even if the underlying theories were sound, educators are frequently unable to correctly identify the theoretically correct learning style for any given student, so the theory would end up being misapplied in practice. Learning Style Inventory [ edit ]\n","#Knowledge-4#:In fact, the panel was able to find only a few studies with this research design, and all but one of these studies were negative findings—that is, they found that the same learning method was superior for all kinds of students. [2] Examples of such negative findings include the research of Laura J. Massa and Richard E. Mayer , [63] as well as more recent research since the 2009 review. [3] [64] [65] Furthermore, the panel noted that, even if the requisite finding were obtained, the benefits would need to be large, and not just statistically significant, before learning style interventions could be recommended as cost-effective. [2] : 116–117 As a consequence, the panel concluded, \"at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number.\"\n","\n"," 97% 5187/5374 [1:39:26<04:43,  1.52s/it]5187 : Which major cities get more international arrivals than Paris?

Cousin marriage was historically practiced by indigenous cultures in Australia , North America , South America , and Polynesia . [7] [8] It is criminalized in 8 states in the US, the only jurisdictions in the world to do so. The laws of many jurisdictions set out the degree of consanguinity prohibited among sexual relations and marriage parties.

The Fisher Space Pen was not developed by NASA #Knowledge-0#:If too hot, though, the ink turned green instead of its normal blue. That same year, Fisher offered the AG-7 \"Anti-Gravity\" Space Pen to NASA. Because of the earlier mechanical pencil fiasco, NASA was hesitant. But, after testing the space pen intensively, the agency decided to use it on spaceflights beginning in 1967. Unlike most ballpoint pens, Fisher's pen does not rely on gravity to get the ink flowing.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The space pen's mark on the Apollo program was not limited to facilitating writing in microgravity. According to the Fisher Space Pen Company, the Apollo 11 astronauts also used the pen to fix a broken arming switch, enabling their return to Earth. Since the late 1960s American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts have used Fisher's pens. In fact, Fisher has created a whole line of space pens. A newer pen, called the Shuttle Pen, was used on NASA's space shuttles and on the Russian space station, Mir.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Pencils may not have been the best choice anyway. The tips flaked and broke off, drifting in microgravity where they could potentially harm an astronaut or equipment. And pencils are flammable--a quality NASA wanted to avoid in onboard objects after the Apollo 1 fire. Paul C. Fisher and his company, the Fisher Pen Company, reportedly invested $1 million to create what is now commonly known as the space pen. None of this investment money came from NASA's coffers--the agency only became involved after the pen was dreamed into existence.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Fisher used ink that stays a gellike solid until the movement of the ballpoint turns it into a fluid. The pressurized nitrogen also prevents air from mixing with the ink so it cannot evaporate or oxidize. According to an Associated Press report from February 1968, NASA ordered 400 of Fisher's antigravity ballpoint pens for the Apollo program. A year later, the Soviet Union ordered 100 pens and 1,000 ink cartridges to use on their Soyuz space missions, said the United Press International. The AP later noted that both NASA and the Soviet space agency received the same 40 percent discount for buying their pens in bulk.\n","#Knowledge-4#:So they spent years and millions of taxpayer dollars to develop a pen that could put ink to paper without gravity. But their crafty Soviet counterparts, so the story goes, simply handed their cosmonauts pencils. This tale with its message of simplicity and thrift--not to mention a failure of common sense in a bureaucracy--floats around the Internet, hopping from in-box to in-box, and even surfaced during a 2002 episode of the West Wing . But, alas, it is just a myth. Originally, NASA astronauts, like the Soviet cosmonauts, used pencils, according to NASA historians.\n","\n"," 97% 5193/5374 [1:39:33<03:14,  1.07s/it]5193 : If it's cold outside, what does that tell us about global warming? The weather on a single day does not tell us about climate trends #Knowledge-0#:Climate is defined as the average weather patterns in a region over a long period of time. It's the difference between Europe's temperate Mediterranean zones versus the harsh, cold conditions of the Arctic tundra. Each of these climate regions experiences day-to-day fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, air pressure, and so on—daily variations known as weather. Climate change is disrupting these predictable fluctuations, creating new climates that are warmer on average and more unpredictable. How warming can lead to cooling When the term \"global warming\" was popularized a few decades ago, it referred to the phenomenon of greenhouse gases trapping heat in the atmosphere and warming the average temperature of the planet.\n","#Knowledge-1#:These swings tend to hang around for awhile, so the weather we have in the eastern United States, whether it’s cold or warm, tends to stay with us longer,\" said study author Jennifer Francis in a press release . The Arctic is warming, on average, four times faster than the rest of the planet, an effect called Arctic amplification . Scientists think this uneven rate of warming is weakening the polar jet stream—the band of air circling the Arctic that typically keeps Arctic air in northern regions—allowing frigid air to more easily dip into the South. ( Learn more about how an El Niño weather pattern is making this winter snowier. ) A future of extreme weather Record cold temperatures and blizzards aren't the only extreme weather patterns expected.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Climate change is making winter weather more predictable. Photograph by Butch Comegys, The Times-Tribune via AP ENVIRONMENT Why cold weather doesn’t mean climate change is fake Weather and climate aren't the same thing, and you can still expect harsh winter storms in a warming world. By Sarah Gibbens January 16, 2024 • 4 min read Cold, Arctic air has descended on large portions of the U.S. and across the South, where this kind of extreme winter weather is rare. In Texas , residents have been asked to conserve energy to avoid electrical outages, and towns in Arkansas saw record low temperatures. These snowy conditions and record cold temperatures follow the hottest year on record , a milestone made possible by climate change.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Scientists believe Earth will experience more extreme, disastrous weather as the effects of climate change play out. Arctic air is increasingly reaching southern latitudes, and North America can expect to see harsher winters as a result. That was the conclusion of a study published in 2017 in the journal Nature Geoscience . It found a link between warmer Arctic temperatures and colder North American winters. A separate study published in March of last year in the journal Nature Communications found the same link but predicted the northeastern portion of the U.S. would be particularly hard hit.\n","#Knowledge-4#:One study published in Science Advances in 2019 predicted extreme, deadly weather events could increase by as much as 50 percent by 2100. But we don't have to wait until 2100 to see how climate change is leading to deadly weather. Scientists say the destructive, record-breaking weather we experienced last year is just a sign of things to come.

Von Dungren claimed A people are superior to B people. Because Asia had more B people than some parts of Europe, the inference was that Asia was inferior (along with European B's) A Japanese scholar, Takeji Furukawa opposed that idea and asserted that B persons were active while A persons were passive. ^ Tsuchimine, Shoko; Saruwatari, Junji; Kaneda, Ayako; Yasui-Furukori, Norio (2015).\n","#Knowledge-2#:Discrimination [ edit ] Blood type harassment, called bura-hara ( wasei-eigo : a portmanteau of blood and harassment ), has been blamed for bullying of children in playgrounds, loss of job opportunities, and ending of happy relationships. [49] Many people in Japan and Korea have been discriminated against because of their blood type. Employers ask blood types during interviews despite the warnings they have been given. Children at schools have been split up according to their blood type. The national softball team has customized training to fit each player's blood type.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Based on a finding that 41.2% of Taiwanese samples had type O blood, Furukawa assumed that the Taiwanese rebelliousness was genetic. His reasoning was supported by the fact that among the Ainu, whose temperament was characterized as submissive, only 23.8% is type O. In conclusion, Furukawa suggested that the Japanese should increase intermarriage with the Taiwanese to reduce the number of Taiwanese with type O blood. [17] Masahiko Nomi [ edit ] Main article: Masahiko Nomi Interest in the theory was revived in the 1970s with a book by Masahiko Nomi , a journalist with no medical background (he graduated from the engineering department of the University of Tokyo). Few Japanese psychologists criticized him at that time, [18] so he continued to demonstrate statistically significant data in various fields and published several books with these results.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Also, it is common for video game series to allow for blood type as an option in their creation modes. [46] After then-Reconstruction Minister Ryu Matsumoto 's abrasive comments towards the governors of Iwate and Miyagi [47] forced him to step down from his post, he partially blamed his behavior on his blood type, saying \"My blood is type B, which means I can be irritable and impetuous, and my intentions don't always come across.\" [48] Blood types are important in South Korea as well.

Now, the latest research shows that drinking at least two cups of coffee per day can increase the life expectancy of consumers by up to around two years. The results of the large and fairly conclusive study titled, “Coffee consumption and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a meta-analysis by potential modifiers,” were published in the latest issue of the European Journal of Epidemiology .

Survivorship bias risk is the chance of an investor making a misguided investment decision based on published investment fund return data. Key Takeaways Survivorship bias occurs when only the winners are considered while the losers that have disappeared are not considered. This can occur when evaluating mutual fund performance (where merged or defunct funds are not included) or market index performance (where stocks that have been dropped from the index for whatever reason are discarded). Survivorship bias skews the average results upward for the index or surviving funds, causing them to appear to perform better since underperformers have been overlooked.\n","#Knowledge-2#:This leads to survivorship bias, since investors may believe that currently, active funds are a true representative of all efforts to manage toward a specific objective historically. Thus, investors may want to include qualitative fund research on a strategy they are interested in investing in to determine if previous managers have tried and failed in the past. Closing to New Investors Funds may close to new investors which is very different than a full fund closing. Closing to new investors may actually be a sign of the popularity of the fund and attention from investors for above-average returns . Reverse Survivorship Bias Reverse survivorship bias describes a far less common situation where low- performers remain in the game, while high performers are inadvertently dropped from the running.\n","#Knowledge-3#:One, the fund undergoes full liquidation and the investors’ shares are sold. This causes potential tax reporting consequences for the investor. Two, the fund may choose to merge. Merged funds are often the best solution for shareholders since they allow for the special transition of shares typically with no tax reporting requirements. However, the performance of the merged funds is therefore also transitioned and can be a factor in the discussion of survivorship bias.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Accessed Aug. 19, 2021.

A circle of salt can be used to control anyone inside the circle #Knowledge-0#:It may be marked physically, drawn in a material like salt, flour, or chalk, or merely visualised. Techniques [ edit ] The figure of a magic circle for the first hour of the Lord's day in spring Traditionally, circles are believed by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summon. [2] Moreover, as magician and historian Jake Stratton-Kent writes, 'In short a circle is not an obsolete symbol of a superstitious fear of spirits, but an intentionally created ritual space for various purposes. It is not always required for all kinds of ritual work, but neither is it of no value, quite the contrary.\n","#Knowledge-1#:In order to leave a circle and keep it intact, Wiccans believe a door must be cut in the energy of the circle, normally on the east side. Whatever was used to cast the circle is used to cut the doorway, such as a sword, staff or knife ( athame ), a doorway is cut in the circle, at which point anything may pass through without harming the circle. [10] This opening must be closed afterwards by reconnecting the lines of the circle. The circle is usually closed by the practitioner after they have finished by drawing in the energy with the athame or whatever was used to make the circle including their hand (usually in a widdershins : that is, counter-clockwise fashion). This is called 'closing the circle' or 'releasing the circle'.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[3] Circles may or may not be physically marked out on the ground, and a variety of elaborate patterns for circle markings can be found in grimoires and magical manuals, often involving angelic and divine names . Such markings, or a simple unadorned circle, may be drawn in chalk or salt , or indicated by other means such as with a cord . [1] Some traditions include tracing or circumambulation . Uses [ edit ] In Sumer [ edit ] The Sumerians called the practice of using ritual circles zisurrû , meaning \"magic circle drawn with flour \", [4] and inscribed ZÌ-SUR-RA -a .\n","#Knowledge-3#:[5] In Judaism [ edit ] Examples of Jewish customs showing the use of the magic circle can be found in the birth protection rituals of Alsace and the surrounding area. As early as 1560, a text by the rabbi Naphtali Hirsch ben Elieser Treves notes a custom in which a circle is drawn around the birthing woman to protect her from Lilith and demons. This was done using a Krasmesser (circle knife) which would be wielded by the midwife or the father of the child. Oral accounts from 20th century Baden-Württemberg in a publication by the Jewish Museum of Switzerland also reference circling movements with a knife in order to protect a woman in childbirth. [6] In the Golden Dawn [ edit ]\n","#Knowledge-4#:In Wicca [ edit ] [ citation needed ] The common technique for raising energy within the circle is by means of a cone of power . [1] The barrier is believed to be fragile, so that leaving or passing through the circle would weaken or dispel it.

No, duck quacks don't echo #Knowledge-0#:Rumor holds that duck's quack doesn't echo, and no one knows why. David Mikkelson Published July 18, 1999 Image courtesy of taviphoto / Shutterstock Claim: A duck's quack doesn't echo, and no one knows why. It is indeed fortunate that the lists are usually composed of items of no real significance, because many of the entries are of dubious veracity. To wit: Ostrich eggs have no yolks, and no one knows why. Julius Caesar was left-handed, and no one knows why.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The winner (so far) of the Most Ludicrous Entry contest is the claim that a duck's quack doesn't echo. Unfortunately, it's also the item we're most frequently asked about. The premise is just silly: a duck's quack (and presumably, of all the sounds known to man, only a duck's quack) has some special sonic property that causes it not to echo. We're not talking about a situation where a landform creates an acoustic shadow (a phenomenon under which even loud sounds can be inaudible to nearby listeners), but the claim that a duck's quack doesn't echo under any conditions. One of the main problems with such a claim is that the term \"a duck's quack\" is non-specific.\n","#Knowledge-2#:He said ducks were normally found in open-water areas and didn't usually congregate around echoey cliffs, which may have fueled the theory that their quacks don't produce an echo. \"You get a bit of reverberation — it's distinctly echoey,\" Cox said. Trevor Cox expounds on this bit of research in his forthcoming work, The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World : There is a saying, \"A duck's quack doesn't echo and no one knows the reason why.\" Hoping to disprove this one slow afternoon at the office, I found myself semiprone on a grassy knoll, pretending to interview a duck named Daisy. Every time she quacked or stretched and opened her wings, camera shutters fluttered like castanets.\n","#Knowledge-3#:So could neighbors who lived a few hundred feet down the street and frequently called us to complain about the noise. The surprise was not that our ducks' quacks didn't echo, but that they echoed so remarkably well. She was then moved to a reverberation chamber with cathedral-like acoustics before the data was used to create simulations of Daisy performing at the Royal Albert Hall and quacking as she flew past a cliff face. The tests revealed that a duck's quack definitely echoes, just like any other sound, but perhaps not as noticeably. \"A duck quacks rather quietly, so the sound coming back is at a low level and might not be heard,\" Cox [said].\n","#Knowledge-4#:The press had caught wind of our modest attempt to correct the misconception about the supposed non-echoing quack and were doing their best to turn it into an international news event. A few months before the photo shoot with Daisy, Danny McCaul, the laboratory manager at Salford University, had been approached by BBC Radio 2 to find out whether the phrase \"a duck's quack doesn't echo\" was true or false. Ignoring Danny's careful explanation of why a quack will echo, the factoid was still broadcast. Annoyed that his acoustic prowess had been overlooked, Danny and some of his colleagues, including me, decided we needed to gather scientific evidence to prove the point. Convincing a farm to lend us a duck and transporting it to the laboratory were probably more time-consuming than the actual experiments.\n","\n"," 97% 5206/5374 [1:39:53<03:56,  1.41s/it]5206 : What happens if you go outdoors in cold weather?

In the fairy tale of Cinderella, her coach transforms back into a pumpkin at midnight #Knowledge-0#:Her fairy godmother magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a pumpkin into a golden carriage , mice into horses, a rat into a coachman , and lizards into footmen . She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Fairy Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before midnight, when the spells will be broken. At the ball, the entire court is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The Fairy Godmother must magically create a coach (from a pumpkin), footmen (from mice), a coach driver (from a frog), and a beautiful dress (from rags) for Cinderella to go to the ball. However, she must return by midnight, as it is then that the spell ceases. Musicals [ edit ] Cinderella by Rodgers and Hammerstein was produced for television three times and staged live in various productions. A version ran in 1958 at the London Coliseum with a cast including Tommy Steele , Yana, Jimmy Edwards , Kenneth Williams and Betty Marsden . This version was augmented with several other Rodgers and Hammerstein 's songs plus a song written by Tommy Steele, \"You and Me\".\n","#Knowledge-2#:Gioachino Rossini , having agreed to do an opera based on Cinderella if he could omit all magical elements, wrote La Cenerentola , in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor. The midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes. In Rossini's opera \" La Cenerentola \" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant The Wonderful Birch the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers.\n","#Knowledge-3#:In the 1812 version the tree also gives Cinderella a carriage with six horses to go to the ball and the pigeons tell her to return before midnight. The episodes in which Cinderella hides in the pigeon coop and on the pear tree were added in the 1819 version.

Archaeologists spend most of their time excavating historical sites #Knowledge-0#:Excavating sites is also costly and time-consuming. Once the dig is done, archaeologists have a professional responsibility to analyze all the artifacts and information obtained, to report on their research, and to curate the collections. For these reasons, archaeologists generally excavate only when there is a threat of destruction or when they may reveal vital information about past cultures. And they usually excavate only a small part of any site. Although archaeologists work on all kinds of environments around the world, they follow the same basic process when planning an excavation.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Archaeologists can use stratigraphy to determine the relative age of each layer and its contents. Top In the Lab Archaeologists spend much more of their time in the laboratory analyzing artifacts and data than they do in the field. Archaeologists analyze artifacts, features, and other information recovered in the field to help answer their research questions. During the investigative process, they might seek to learn when people occupied the site, the purpose of the objects recovered, what the people ate, the kinds of structures they built, with whom they traded, and much more. They may also look at how the site they are analyzing relates to other sites.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Or, the sites may or may not be \"significant\" as defined by the law in the National Historic Preservation Act . Regardless, the archaeologist will write and file a site report with the State Historic Preservation Office, which describes their research. If they found significant sites, they might plan further excavations. Top Data Recovery Believe it or not archaeologists rarely excavate (dig) entire sites! Archaeology is a destructive science—meaning that once a site is excavated, it is gone forever.\n","#Knowledge-3#:This outlines the \"who, what, where, when, how, and why\" of the fieldwork. Archaeologists must submit this important document for review before gaining permission to excavate a site. In the U.S., the State Historic Preservation Office reviews this plan. If an American archaeologist wants to work in a foreign country, permission must be granted by the appropriate agency in that government. Tribal (American Indian) lands in the U.S. have their own review processes, and some tribes have their own archaeology programs that control access to sites on tribal lands.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Through the oral traditions of modern Puebloan people, they learned about the past culture of their Anasazi ancestors. Top Preparing for the Field While historians and archaeologists both use written documents to learn about the past, only archaeologists interpret archaeological sites. That involves unique field work. Tools of the Trade You may think of shovels when you think of digging, but the most important piece of equipment in the archaeologist’s toolkit is the trowel. Archaeologists use trowels to scrape away thin layers of soil from test units, or holes in the ground.\n","\n"," 97% 5209/5374 [1:39:56<03:20,  1.21s/it]5209 : Are there wizards living in the West Country?

Accordingly, you can safely state your opinion that others are inept, stupid, jerks, failures, etc. even though these statements might hurt the subject's feelings or diminish their reputations. Such terms represent what is called \"pure opinions\" because they can't be proven true or false. As a result, they cannot form the basis for a defamation claim. This is not to say that every statement of opinion is protected.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Keep in mind, however, that you can't make a statement an opinion merely by prefacing it with \"in my opinion.\" Saying that \"in my opinion, Alex stole ten dollars from the church collection basket\" would lead most listeners to conclude you had evidence that Alex had indeed stolen the money, and that you intend the statement as one of fact rather than opinion. The courts do not give protection to false factual connotations disguised as opinions. Context and the Totality of the Circumstances In general, courts will look at the context and medium in which the alleged defamation occurred. For example, a statement is more likely to be regarded as an opinion rather than a fact if it occurs in an editorial blog as opposed to a piece of investigative journalism.\n","#Knowledge-2#:If a statement is a \"pure opinion,\" it cannot be the basis for a defamation claim. Of course, it is not always easy to determine whether a statement is a pure opinion. As we noted above, opinions that imply false underlying facts will not be protected. For example, stating that \"Chris is insane\" could be both a fact and an opinion. It could mean Chris has been diagnosed with psychosis and needs to be hospitalized in a mental institution; this could be proven false.\n","#Knowledge-3#:For example, stating that \"in my opinion, the mayor killed her husband\" is not likely to be a protected opinion. Couching false statements of fact as opinion or within quotes from other sources generally won’t protect you either. Nor will trying to cover yourself by saying that a politician “allegedly” is a drug dealer, or that your neighbor said the politician “is a drug dealer,” or that in your opinion, the politician is a drug dealer. A reader may well assume you have unstated facts to base your conclusion on, and it would be a defamatory statement if the implied facts turn out to be false. All opinions that rely on underlying facts, however, are not necessarily outside the opinion privilege.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Is the statement verifiable? Can it be proven false? What is the full context of the statement? What are the social conventions surrounding the medium the statement occurred in?

The T-Rex and humans lived closer in time #Knowledge-0#:The so-called Age of Mammals—which began when the non-avian dinosaurs were wiped out—has been going on for about 66 million years. Less time separates us from Tyrannosaurus rex than separated T. rex from Stegosaurus . Consider how much life has changed in the past 66 million years. Archaic mammals flourished and ultimately went extinct long before anything like the world’s modern fauna appeared. Saber-fanged, knobbly-headed herbivores such as Uintatherium , lemur-like primates called adapiforms , razor-jawed carnivores known as creodonts and many other strange forms proliferated and disappeared.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Photo by the author You can’t understand dinosaurs without a sense of time. We need to know when a dinosaur lived to comprehend how it fits into what paleontologist William Diller Matthew called “life’s splendid drama.” But we throw around Deep Time estimates, framed in millions of years, so often that it’s easy to become inured to the wider context of life’s history. The Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 250 million to 66 million years ago, is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. As a kid, this brought to mind one endless summer when dinosaurs flourished.\n","#Knowledge-2#:But let’s unpack some of that scenery. Diplodocus , Apatosaurus , Allosaurus , Stegosaurus and their neighbors roamed western North America about 150 million years ago. This slice of time falls in the latter portion of the Jurassic. The traditional representatives of the latest Cretaceous scene— Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops —did not evolve until about 67 million years ago. By themselves, these dates are just labels, but think of them falling along evolution’s timeline.\n","#Knowledge-3#:The time between the last Triceratops and now has seen radical evolutionary changes. Now think of the 83 million years between the Jurassic and Cretaceous titans. These are just a few highlights, and that is part of the wonder and frustration of tracking the history of life on earth. We are offered only glimpses of an ever-changing picture, and when viewed separately, it’s easy to forget how those snippets relate to each other. But when we can step back, and consider how all those snippets run together, the long and ever-changing history of life on our planet seems all the more fantastic.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Riley Black | | READ MORE Riley Black is the author of The Last Days of the Dinosaurs and many other books.

No, there is no transfer of abilities from music to thinking #Knowledge-0#:That's exactly the question that many researchers over the years have tried to answer. Some of their studies concluded that it does, and some found that it doesn't. For example, one study showed that music education did not improve reading skills, while another one found a small effect of music on young children's ability to manipulate syllables and words. If music doesn't make you smarter, how does that explain other research that show that music lessons help students' school performance? For example, last year a large study from Canada found that high school students did better in math, science and English classes if they also took music lessons.\n","#Knowledge-1#:At first glance, that sounds very different from what this new study by Sala and Gobet found. How can it be possible for music lessons to have no effect on intelligence, and still lead to kids doing better in school? It seems like there is something about music lessons that makes students able to perform better in their other classes. That doesn't have to be intelligence, and it's likely not. If intelligence was the main factor behind school performance, every student would always do equally well in their classes.\n","#Knowledge-2#:If you believe music is valuable as a creative skill, or an enriching social activity, then this research won't affect you much. It's only a concern if you think music is a way to increase intelligence - but this isn't the first time that the link between music and intelligence has been disproven. For a while, there was an idea floating around the internet and various magazines that suggested that babies could become smarter if they listened to Mozart, or to other classical music. Inspired, some parents bought classical CDs for their babies in the hopes that this would boost their intelligence. But this so-called \"Mozart Effect\" has been debunked several times.\n","#Knowledge-3#:The authors of the study, Giovanni Sala (Fujita Health University) and Fernand Gobet (London School of Economics) did a systematic analysis of several studies that all looked at the effect of music on measures of intelligence or academic achievement. They looked at how music lessons affected students' scores on memory tests, for example, or on tests that measured their reasoning skills, literacy skills or ability to solve mathematics problems. The researchers chose a set of strict criteria to select these studies, so that they would be able to compare similar types of experiments between papers. For example, they only compared studies that had randomly assigned students to either receive music lessons or not, and ignored studies on existing music classes (without a non-music control). Is this something to worry about?\n","#Knowledge-4#:Grades go up and down over the years so there must be other factors besides intelligence or the ability to take a test that could affect how well someone does in school. Music lessons could have helped in different ways: They could have led to a change in homework habits, they could have increased confidence, or they could have improved social skills. Sala and Gobet's analysis only looked at measures of intelligence and performance on particular tests, not at any of the other possible factors that would lead a student to do better in class. The authors even mention this in their paper. They say \"music may be beneficial for non-cognitive constructs in children, such as prosocial behavior and self-esteem\".\n","\n"," 97% 5217/5374 [1:40:05<02:30,  1.04it/s]5217 : What law of human psychology is established by Baumeister's ego depletion experiments? No law of ego depletion is established because the experiments have not been replicated #Knowledge-0#:[3] The ultimate validity and conclusions of those later studies is not universally agreed upon. [5] Martin Hagger and Nikos Chatzisrantis, whose 2010 meta-analysis seemed to support the existence of the ego depletion effect, [5] subsequently performed a pre-registered 23 lab replication study which did not find an ego-depletion effect. [6] Early experimental evidence [ edit ] American social psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues proposed a model that described self-control like a muscle, which can become both strengthened and fatigued. The researches proposed that initial use of the “muscle” of self-control could cause a decrease in strength, or ego depletion, for subsequent tasks. Later experimental findings showed support for this muscle model of self-control and ego depletion.\n","#Knowledge-1#:These studies are the most promising studies for a replication project to examine whether ego-depletion effects can be replicated consistently across several independent laboratories. [40] In 2016, a major multi-lab replication study (2141 participants) carried out at two dozen labs across the world using a single protocol failed to find any evidence for ego depletion. Replication difficulties have also emerged for 5 additional protocols (operationalizations) of the basic ego depletion effect.

F.; Bratslavsky, E.; Muraven, M.; Tice, D. M. (1998).\n","#Knowledge-2#:The ego depletion effect itself (without mood intervention), has however been shown to be unrelated to mood changes, as shown in multiple ego depletion experiments that either controlled for mood, or saw no mood changes. Thus, positive affect is just a way to counteract ego depletion after a person is depleted. Theoretical explanations [ edit ] Conservation hypothesis [ edit ] The conservation hypothesis is a partial explanation of ego depletion. It suggests that there are two sorts of depletion: When one is completely depleted and unable to self-control.\n","#Knowledge-3#:\"A Multilab Preregistered Replication of the Ego-Depletion Effect\" .

High in the Andes he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls . [63] [64] On the geologically new Galápagos Islands , Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older \"centre of creation\", and found mockingbirds allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island.

On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species , promoted by Grant and younger surgeons influenced by Geoffroy .

Parents in England and Wales can currently face criminal charges if they hit a child so hard that it leaves a mark, or causes bruising, swelling, cuts, grazes or scratches.

It will begin in 2022.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The researchers estimated that between 70% and 80% of parents in the UK had used physical punishment, with children aged between three and seven the most likely to be smacked. They also found that many parents did not view smacking as a \"good thing\", but believed that sometimes it was the \"only thing that will work\". Research examining the views of children on smacking has suggested that it hurts and upsets them, and does not always stop bad behaviour. What do opponents of the ban say? A campaign against the ban was led by the Be Reasonable Scotland group, which called the legislation \"draconian\" and argued it could do more harm than good.\n","#Knowledge-3#:What was the law on physical punishment of children? In practice, this generally meant parents were allowed to smack their children on the body - but blows to the head, shaking or the use of an implement were illegal. All physical punishment in schools and other education settings was already completely banned. How will this change? The bill will end the defence of \"reasonable chastisement\", meaning parents could face prosecution for any use of physical punishment on their children.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Children's charity the NSPCC said Scotland's ban was a \"common sense\" move. Mr Finnie said smacking teaches children that \"might is right\", and that the ban would \"send a strong message that violence is never acceptable in any setting\". Children's Minister Maree Todd said: \"This outdated defence has no place in a modern Scotland. It can never be reasonable to strike a child.\" Opponents argued the changes were \"unnecessary\" as existing laws already protected children from abuse at the hands of adults.\n","\n"," 97% 5224/5374 [1:40:13<02:41,  1.08s/it]5224 : It's illegal to marry which relative (in Canada)? You are not allowed to marry your parents, children or siblings in Canada #Knowledge-0#:Those who do not wish to marry based on the personal laws governed by religious and cultural practices may opt for marriage under this law. It defines the first-cousin relationship, both parallel and cross , as prohibited. Conflict may arise between the prohibited degrees based on this law and personal law, but in absence of any other laws, it is still unresolved. [150] Cousin marriage is proscribed and seen as incest for Hindus in North India . In fact, it may even be unacceptable to marry within one's village or for two siblings to marry partners from the same village.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[69] The Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria, who are predominantly Christian, strictly practice non-consanguineal marriages, where kinfolks and cousins are not allowed to marry or have intimacy. Consequently men and women are forbidden to marry within their recent patrilineage and matrilineage. Before the advent of Christianity through colonization, the Igbos had always frowned upon and specifically prohibited consanguineal marriages, both the parallel and cross-cousin types, which are considered incestuous and cursed. Arranged marriages, albeit in great decline, were also to consciously prevent accidental consanguineal and bad marriages, such that the impending in-laws were aware of each other's family histories. Currently, as in the old days, before courtship commences thorough enquiries are made by both families not only to ascertain character traits but to also ensure their children are not related by blood.\n","#Knowledge-2#:This was not always the case, however: the Catholic Church has gone through several phases in kinship prohibitions. At the dawn of Christianity in Roman times, marriages between first cousins were allowed. For example, Emperor Constantine , the first Christian Roman Emperor, married his children to the children of his half-brother. First and second cousin marriages were then banned at the Council of Agde in AD 506, though dispensations sometimes continued to be granted. By the 11th century, with the adoption of the so-called canon-law method of computing consanguinity, these proscriptions had been extended even to sixth cousins, including by marriage.\n","#Knowledge-3#:It is customary for parents to bring their children up to know their immediate cousins and, when opportune, their distant cousins. They encourage their adult children to disclose their love interests for consanguineal screening. [70] In Ethiopia most of the population was historically rigidly opposed to cousin marriage and could consider up to third cousins the equivalent of brother and sister, with marriage at least ostensibly prohibited out to sixth cousins. [71] They also took affinal prohibitions very seriously. The prospect of a man marrying a former wife's ‘sister’ was seen as incest, and conversely for a woman and her former husband's ‘brother’.\n","#Knowledge-4#:First in line would be either her father's brothers or their sons, followed by her father's sisters' sons. [99] Early medieval [ edit ] According to Goody, cousin marriage was allowed in the newly Christian and presumably also pre-Christian Ireland, where an heiress was also obligated to marry a paternal cousin. From the seventh century, the Irish Church only recognized four degrees of prohibited kinship , and civil law fewer. This persisted until after the Norman conquests in the 11th century and the synod at Cashel in 1101.\n","\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","Done\n","File written\n"," 97% 5225/5374 [1:40:15<03:18,  1.33s/it]5225 : Why is Russia a member of the EU?

[24] However, other studies claim internal enlargement is legally viable if, in case of a member state dissolution or secession, the resulting states are all considered successor states . [25] There is also a European Citizens' Initiative that aims at guaranteeing the continuity of rights and obligations of the European citizens belonging to a new state arising from the democratic secession of a European Union member state. [26] As of 2024, the United Kingdom is the only former member state.

Toast bread in the oven — or consider separate toasters — to avoid cross-contamination. Read restaurant menus online ahead of time if possible to be sure there are options for you. Eat out early or late when a restaurant is less busy and better able to address your needs. Results Keeping a strict gluten-free diet is a lifelong necessity for people with celiac disease.\n","#Knowledge-1#:For example, whole-grain breads and other products are natural or enriched sources of the following: Iron Calcium Fiber Thiamin Riboflavin Niacin Folate Therefore, following a gluten-free diet will likely change your nutrient intake. Some gluten-free breads and cereals have significantly varied nutrient levels compared with the products they are replacing. Some gluten-free foods also have higher fat and sugar contents than the gluten-containing food being replaced. It's important to read labels, not only for gluten content but also for overall nutrient levels, salt, calories from fats and calories from sugars. You can talk to your doctor or dietitian about foods that would provide healthy, nutrient-rich alternatives.\n","#Knowledge-2#:By Mayo Clinic Staff Definition A gluten-free diet is an eating plan that excludes foods containing gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and triticale (a cross between wheat and rye). Purpose A gluten-free diet is essential for managing signs and symptoms of celiac disease and other medical conditions associated with gluten. A gluten-free diet is also popular among people who haven't been diagnosed with a gluten-related medical condition. The claimed benefits of the diet are improved health, weight loss and increased energy, but more research is needed.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Diet details Following a gluten-free diet requires paying careful attention to food selections, the ingredients found in foods, and their nutritional content. Allowed fresh foods Many naturally gluten-free foods can be a part of a healthy diet: Oats and oat products labeled gluten-free have not been cross-contaminated. Some people with celiac disease, however, cannot tolerate the gluten-free-labeled oats. Wheat terms to know There are different varieties of wheat, all of which contain wheat gluten: Durum Einkorn Emmer Kamut Spelt Wheat flours have different names based on how the wheat is milled or the flour is processed.\n","#Knowledge-4#:It's important to read labels of processed foods to determine if they contain wheat, as well as barley and rye. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the drugs you're taking. Dietary supplements that contain wheat gluten must have \"wheat\" stated on the label. Eating gluten-free at home and in restaurants For people with celiac disease, in particular, it's important to avoid exposure to gluten.

[6] Historian Jeffrey Burton Russell says the flat-Earth error flourished most between 1870 and 1920, and had to do with the ideological setting created by struggles over biological evolution . [2] [7] [8] History [ edit ] In Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians , Jeffrey Russell describes the Flat Earth theory as a fable used to impugn pre-modern civilization and creationism .\n","#Knowledge-1#:He felt sure the Earth was round. [31] A 2009 survey of schoolbooks from Austria and Germany showed that the Flat Earth myth became dominant in the second half of the 20th century and persists in most historical textbooks written for German and Austrian schools. [32] As recently as 1983, Daniel Boorstin published a historical survey, The Discoverers , which presented the Flammarion engraving on its cover and proclaimed that \"from AD 300 to at least 1300 ... Christian faith and dogma suppressed the useful image of the world that had been so ... scrupulously drawn by ancient geographers.\" [33] Boorstin dedicated a chapter to the flat Earth, in which he portrayed Cosmas Indicopleustes as the founder of Christian geography.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[11] ), were used to discredit opposing authorities several centuries before the 19th. Another early mention in literature is Ludvig Holberg 's comedy Erasmus Montanus (1723). Erasmus Montanus meets considerable opposition when he claims the Earth is round, since all the peasants hold it to be flat. He is not allowed to marry his fiancée until he cries \"The Earth is flat as a pancake\". In Thomas Jefferson 's book Notes on the State of Virginia (1784), framed as answers to a series of questions (queries), Jefferson uses the \"Query\" regarding religion to attack the idea of state-sponsored official religions.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand the Catholic quarrel about the shape of the Earth; the king states the Earth is flat. In Walt Disney's 1963 animation The Sword in the Stone , wizard Merlin (who has traveled into the future) explains to a young Arthur that \"man will discover in centuries to come\" that the Earth is round, and rotates . [36] The Biblical view [ edit ] The Hebrew Bible depicts a three-part world, with the heavens ( shamayim ) above, Earth (eres) in the middle, and the underworld (sheol) below. [37] The Old Testament teaches the view that was current at the time and place of its writing: that the earth is a disk, with stars on a firmament above it, and beyond the stars is the cosmic sea.\n","#Knowledge-4#:[39] The need for a literal interpretation is forcefully argued in creationism , which affirms the cosmology in Genesis 1, in which the stars are in a firmament between the earth and the waters above. However, most creationists genuinely accept both the fact that the earth is round with the stars beyond the clouds and also the belief that Genesis 1 is literally true. Mentelle had described the Middle Ages as twelve ignorant centuries of \"profound night\", a theme exemplified by the flat-Earth myth in Letronne's \"On the Cosmological Opinions of the Church Fathers\".

[18] [19] The constitution of Germany , implemented in 1949 following the end of World War II , defines a German as a German citizen . [20] During the 19th and much of the 20th century, discussions on German identity were dominated by concepts of a common language, culture, descent, and history. [21] Today, the German language is widely seen as the primary, though not exclusive, criterion of German identity.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The English term Germans is derived from the ethnonym Germani , which was used for Germanic peoples in ancient times. [24] [25] Since the early modern period, it has been the most common name for the Germans in English. The term Germans may also be applied to any citizens, natives or inhabitants of Germany, regardless of whether they are considered to have German ethnicity.

All the magic users in the series are referred to by pseudonyms, and many of them went to great lengths to kill anyone who knew their original names. In Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle , magicians can control someone by learning their true name, and use the true name of inanimate objects in spells. Patricia Wrede , in her novel Snow-White and Rose-Red , has a character not succumb to a spell because the caster did not know the name he was baptized by. Patricia McKillip , in her novel The Forgotten Beasts of Eld , wizards, including the main character Sybel, can call people and creatures using their true name.\n","#Knowledge-1#:According to practices in folklore , referred to as 'the Law of Names'; knowledge of a true name allows one to affect another person or being magically . [11] It is stated that knowing someone's, or something's, true name therefore gives the person (who knows the true name) power over them. This effect is used in many tales, [12] such as in the German fairytale of Rumpelstiltskin : within Rumpelstiltskin and all its variants, the girl can free herself from the power of a supernatural helper who demands her child by learning its name. [13] A legend of Saint Olaf recounts how a troll built a church for the saint at a fantastic speed and price, but the saint was able to free himself by learning the troll's name during a walk in the woods.

A character remembering their true name may be an important means of maintaining mastery of their own life.

The measurement of income from individuals and households, which is necessary to produce statistics such as the median, can pose challenges and yield results inconsistent with aggregate national accounts data. For example, an academic study on the Census income data claims that when correcting for underreporting, U.S. median gross household income was 15% higher in 2010 (table 3). In that case, the adjusted, or \"equivalised,\" income is assigned to each member of the household before statistics such as the median are computed at the individual level.

There are many conspiracy theories claiming that the U.S. government caused 9/11, but evidence points to Al-Qaeda #Knowledge-0#:[398] 9/11 conspiracy theories have become a social phenomenon, despite a lack of support from expert scientists, engineers, and historians. [400] [401] The culture of America, after the attacks, is noted for heightened security and an increased demand thereof, as well as paranoia and anxiety regarding future terrorist attacks against most of the nation. Psychologists have also confirmed that there has been an increased amount of national anxiety in commercial air travel. [402] Anti-Muslim hate crimes rose nearly ten-fold in 2001 and have subsequently remained \"roughly five times higher than the pre-9/11 rate\". [404] As a result of the attacks, many governments across the world passed legislation to combat terrorism.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[427] In January 2023, the US government opened up about a potential plea deal , [428] with Biden giving up on the effort in September that year.

[431] Investigations FBI Further information: Hijackers in the September 11 attacks Immediately after the attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation started PENTTBOM , the largest criminal inquiry in United States history. At its height, more than half of the FBI's agents worked on the investigation and followed a half-million leads. [432] The FBI concluded that there was \"clear and irrefutable\" evidence linking Al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks.\n","#Knowledge-2#:In Amenas The September 11 attacks , commonly known as 9/11 , [f] were four coordinated Islamist suicide terrorist attacks carried out by al-Qaeda against the United States in 2001. That morning, 19 terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners scheduled to travel from the East Coast to California . The third team succeeded in striking the Pentagon , the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense in Arlington County, Virginia , while the fourth plane crashed in rural Pennsylvania during a passenger revolt. The September 11 attacks killed 2,977 people, making them the deadliest terrorist attack in history.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[76] [77] Other motives have been suggested in addition to those stated by bin Laden and Al-Qaeda. Similarly, others have argued the 9/11 attacks were a strategic move to provoke America into a war that would incite a pan-Islamic revolution.

During 1683, Vienna was the seat of the Holy Roman Empire and Habsburg monarchy , both major powers in Europe at the time. For Osama bin Laden, this was a date when the West gained some dominance over Islam, and by attacking on this date, he hoped to make a step in Islam \"winning\" the war for worldwide power and influence. The NSA intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting, Mihdhar, and the name \"Nawaf\" (Hazmi); while the agency feared \"Something nefarious might be afoot\", it took no further action.

Scientists acknowledge that crystals release blocked energy #Knowledge-0#:Adherents of the practice claim that these have healing powers, but there is no scientific basis for this claim. [1] [2] [3] Practitioners of crystal healing believe they can boost low energy, prevent bad energy , release blocked energy, and transform a body's aura . Scientific investigations have found no evidence that such \"energy grids\" actually exist, and there is no evidence that crystal healing has any greater effect upon the body than any other placebo . Where the practice is popular, it fosters commercial demand for crystals, which can result in environmental damage and exploitative child labor to mine the crystals.

[21] In 1999, researchers French and Williams conducted a study to investigate the power of crystals compared with a placebo. Eighty volunteers were asked to meditate with either a quartz crystal, or a placebo stone which was indistinguishable from quartz. Many of the participants reported feeling typical \"crystal effects\"; however, this was irrespective of whether the crystals were real or placebo.

They encourage their adult children to disclose their love interests for consanguineal screening. [70] In Ethiopia most of the population was historically rigidly opposed to cousin marriage and could consider up to third cousins the equivalent of brother and sister, with marriage at least ostensibly prohibited out to sixth cousins. [71] They also took affinal prohibitions very seriously. The prospect of a man marrying a former wife's ‘sister’ was seen as incest, and conversely for a woman and her former husband's ‘brother’.\n","#Knowledge-1#:[29] Eventually, the mother's sister's children and cross cousins shared one set of terms, with only the father's brother's children retaining a separate set.

[32] Another research describes marrying a mother's sister's daughter (MSD) as being tolerated, but a father's brother's daughter (FBD, or táng relatives in Chinese) is strongly disfavored.

[99] Early medieval [ edit ] According to Goody, cousin marriage was allowed in the newly Christian and presumably also pre-Christian Ireland, where an heiress was also obligated to marry a paternal cousin. From the seventh century, the Irish Church only recognized four degrees of prohibited kinship , and civil law fewer. This persisted until after the Norman conquests in the 11th century and the synod at Cashel in 1101.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage in societies with matrilineal descent meant that a male married into the family his mother's brother, building an alliance between the two families. However, marriage to a mother's sister daughter (a parallel cousin) would be endogamous , here meaning inside the same descent group, and would therefore fail to build alliances between different groups. Correspondingly, in societies like China with patrilineal descent, marriage to a father's brother's daughter would fail at alliance building. And in societies with both types of descent, where a person belongs to the group of his mother's mother and father's father but not mother's father or father's mother, only cross-cousin marriages would successfully build alliances. Whereas in other kinship systems one or another of these aspects dominates, in cross-cousin marriage they overlap and cumulate their effects.\n","\n"," 98% 5247/5374 [1:40:42<02:38,  1.25s/it]5247 : What is the origin of \"420\" as a term for weed?

As a matter of fact, there are all kinds of myths that circulate about how you can kill a frog just by holding it, but some of these myths are combinations of assumptions with actual dangers for the creature. While you may not cause a frog psychological damage that’ll make it commit suicide after being held, you could cause it to dislocate a leg, making it helpless and sentenced to death upon release . When you hold a frog too tight, aside from the obvious effects of squeezing it until it literally bursts, it may start kicking in order to escape. This vigorous kicking is what tends to cause dislocations and other injuries for the frog.\n","#Knowledge-1#:He also says that the only known carriers of HPV are us humans. However, Litt warns that the wart-like bumps we see on toads, specifically behind the ears, aren’t completely safe, and can cause harms in many other ways, as these glands are meant for infecting and irritating the mouths of predators with poison. The assumption that these wart-like glands were actually warts, combined with the fear that touching warts will transmit the virus ( only true in some cases) is what lead people to believe that touching a warty toad would make them warty. Additionally, frogs can also transfer bacteria and diseases to humans that could be fatal if you were not to use a strong antibacterial soap after making contact with them. So while you may not get warts from touching amphibians, you should always make sure your hands are clean afterwards, because they can be harmful.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Reply There are all kinds of myths and urban legends surrounding the harms of human contact with frogs, toads, and the likes of such. These supposed “harms” range from the possible health effects to humans, as well as to the amphibians themselves.

For starters, the most common fear about amphibians, toads specifically, is that they give you warts .\n","#Knowledge-3#:However, the danger is still there for those inexperienced in handling amphibians! Just maybe not for the reason you think. Finally, avoid any form of oral contact with amphibians. Contrary to the belief that kissing a frog will turn him into a prince, it won’t, and it might even give you salmonella . The myth obviously comes from popular fairy tales and children’s books, but believe it or not, that doesn’t add any truth to it.\n","#Knowledge-4#:I personally thought that handling frogs had the potential to give you warts, and did not know one has to be so careful when handling a frog.

Snakes stretch out near other animals to check the length of their prey #Knowledge-0#:There's little fretting in their nature about relative sizes of intended edibles, nor does all that much go into their thinking process. To look at it another way, if pythons were in the habit of measuring before striking, they'd likely starve. Most of their prey wouldn't willingly wait for them to finish mimicking tape measures before consenting to be eaten; they would hop away to safety as soon as they noticed large snakes stretching out alongside them. And while a really big snake could indeed swallow a person's arm, it's quite unlikely that the kinds of snakes typically kept as pets in homes could get their jaws open wide enough to take in an adult human's head and shoulders. Those who keep fairly large snakes as pets generally know that it's perfectly normal for their pets to go without food for fairly long periods of time and thus scoff at the notion that a snake's not eating would be cause to rush it to a vet.\n","#Knowledge-1#:(There are other methods for dealing with non-eating snakes, including, in extreme circumstances, force-feeding.)

It was spoken by the independent kings of Galloway in their time, and by the people of Galloway and Carrick until the early modern period. It was also once spoken, but much less so in Annandale and Strathnith . Scottish Gaelic, along with modern Manx and Irish, is descended from Middle Irish , a derivative of Old Irish , which is descended in turn from Primitive Irish , the oldest known form of the Goidelic languages. Primitive Irish is known only from fragments, mostly personal names, inscribed on stone in the Ogham alphabet in Ireland and western Britain up to about the 6th century AD.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Aberdeen University Press. p. ix.

However, as Gaelic medium education grows in popularity, a newer generation of literate Gaels is becoming more familiar with modern Gaelic vocabulary. The influence of Scottish Gaelic can be seen particularly in surnames (notably Mac- names, where the mac means \"Son of...\") and toponymy.

Although native speakers frequently use an English word for which there is a perfectly good Gaelic equivalent, they will, without thinking, simply adopt the English word and use it, applying the rules of Gaelic grammar, as the situation requires.\n","#Knowledge-4#:There are also many Brittonic influences on Scottish Gaelic. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but as Q-Celtic has a far greater overlap with P-Celtic than with English in terms of vocabulary, it is not always possible to disentangle P- and Q-Celtic words. However some common words, such as monadh ≡ Welsh mynydd , Cumbric * monidh , are particularly evident. Often the Brittonic influence on Scots Gaelic is indicated by comparing with the Irish Gaelic usage which is not likely to have been influenced so much by Brittonic. In particular, the word srath (anglicised as \"Strath\") is a native Goidelic word, but its usage appears to have been modified by its Brittonic cognate ystrad , whose meaning is slightly different.\n","\n"," 98% 5254/5374 [1:40:49<02:16,  1.14s/it]5254 : Neo-con American politician and businessman for the Republicans, with a long and varied career.

Only humans can learn language #Knowledge-0#:Skip to main content Scientific American Sign in March 1, 2017 Can Animals Acquire Language? Despite claims that this is possible, the evidence says no By Hanoch Ben-Yami Richard Ashurst Flickr ( CC BY 2.0 ) Homer, Darwin and Einstein could obviously not have achieved what they did without language—but neither could a child in kindergarten. And this raises an important question about animal intelligence. Although we don’t expect a chimpanzee to write an epic or a dolphin to develop a scientific theory, it has frequently been asked whether these or other animals are close in intelligence to young children.\n","#Knowledge-1#:But their resemblance to humans stops there. Human beings, as Aristotle observed and Descartes reiterated, are animals with a language. And language here is also logos , that is, logic or rationality. And experience teaches us that these are absent from the rest of the animal kingdom. Scientific American maintains a strict policy of editorial independence in reporting developments in science to our readers.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Since normativity is essential to our language, animals don’t have a language in the sense we do. Animals produce sounds that express their emotions, and some can use signs in a Pavlovian way, as a result of an association between previous uses and succeeding events. But without “Why?” and “No!” there’s nothing resembling human language. And the distinctions don’t stop there. To ascribe a mistake to another is to ascribe him a belief which is not true.\n","#Knowledge-3#:In the last half century, much effort has been put trying answer that question by teaching animals, primarily apes, a basic language. There have been some limited successes, with animals using signs to obtain things in which they were interested, for instance. But no animal has yet acquired the linguistic capability that children have already in their third year of life. “Why?” On supporting science journalism If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing .\n","#Knowledge-4#:Another essential characteristic of our language is its normativity—namely, the fact that there are right and wrong uses of a word or phrase. We understand, for instance, that we used a certain word wrongly, or that we don’t yet know how to use it. Animals’ use of language does not have this aspect. An animal might use a sign the way we intended it to be used, or it might not yet use the sign that way. But the animal itself cannot understand that it doesn’t know how to use the sign or that it has used it incorrectly.\n","\n"," 98% 5259/5374 [1:40:55<02:19,  1.22s/it]5259 : What happens if a girl kisses a frog? The frog will transform into a human #Knowledge-0#:However, the danger is still there for those inexperienced in handling amphibians! Just maybe not for the reason you think. Finally, avoid any form of oral contact with amphibians. Contrary to the belief that kissing a frog will turn him into a prince, it won’t, and it might even give you salmonella . The myth obviously comes from popular fairy tales and children’s books, but believe it or not, that doesn’t add any truth to it.\n","#Knowledge-1#:The assumption that these wart-like glands were actually warts, combined with the fear that touching warts will transmit the virus ( only true in some cases) is what lead people to believe that touching a warty toad would make them warty. Additionally, frogs can also transfer bacteria and diseases to humans that could be fatal if you were not to use a strong antibacterial soap after making contact with them. So while you may not get warts from touching amphibians, you should always make sure your hands are clean afterwards, because they can be harmful. A common fear of holding amphibians, for the sake of the creatures themselves, is that by holding them, you’ll harm them… In some way.\n","#Knowledge-2#:For starters, the most common fear about amphibians, toads specifically, is that they give you warts . The means of which they’re transferred to us have been described as anywhere from touching a toad, to outright kissing a frog! Well, according to dermatologist Jerry Litt , frogs and toads do not carry the wart virus, because rather, it is exclusively a human virus. Specifically, Jeff Benson, M.D. says that warts are actually cased by what’s known as human papillomavirus (HPV) , which is a skin cell infection. He also says that the only known carriers of HPV are us humans.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Welcome Course Blog Contributions Blurb Resources Tech FAQ Instructors Andrew’s Blog How safe is it to hold frogs and toads? 1 Reply There are all kinds of myths and urban legends surrounding the harms of human contact with frogs, toads, and the likes of such.

But how many of them are actually true, and for the ones that don’t quite make the cut, where the hell did those ideas come from in the first place?\n","#Knowledge-4#:Well, I didn’t necessarily expect to learn so much about frogs today. Jokes aside, I found your post to both very informative and enlightening.

[1] From 1930 onwards, many books of undoubted literary merit, as well as serious books on reproductive issues and sexual health, were banned. Banned books were listed in the Government publication Iris Oifigiúil , and the list, or a selection, was usually published in the Irish Times . [4] The Censorship of Publications Act, 1967, limited the period of prohibition orders of books to twelve years (although books released after this period could be banned again by the Board).\n","#Knowledge-4#:[5] Contrary to popular belief, James Joyce 's Ulysses was technically never banned in Ireland, but this was because it was never imported and offered for sale, for fear of such a ban and its attendant costs. In 1942 Senator Sir John Keane told the Seanad that 1,600 books had been banned since independence in 1922. [6] He quoted examples of supposed indecency from several books to ridicule the law; prudishly , his extracts were not reported verbatim, but as: \"[The Senator quoted from the book.]\". [7] Books containing references to terrorism or which could be considered slander under Irish law can still be banned – one will not be prosecuted for owning or importing them, but their sale is prohibited.

Humans have 10 finger bones #Knowledge-0#:The palm has five bones known as metacarpal bones, one to each of the five digits. Human hands contain fourteen digital bones, also called phalanges, or phalanx bones : two in the thumb (the thumb has no middle phalanx) and three in each of the four fingers. These are the distal phalanx, carrying the nail, the middle phalanx, and the proximal phalanx. Joints are formed wherever two or more of these bones meet. Sesamoid bones are small ossified nodes embedded in the tendons to provide extra leverage and reduce pressure on the underlying tissue.\n","#Knowledge-1#:A finger is a prominent digit on the forelimbs of most tetrapod vertebrate animals , especially those with prehensile extremities (i.e. hands ) such as humans and other primates . Most tetrapods have five digits ( pentadactyly ), [1] [2] and short digits (i.e. significantly shorter than the metacarpal / metatarsals ) are typically referred to as toes , while those that are notably elongated are called fingers. In humans, the fingers are flexibly articulated and opposable , serving as an important organ of tactile sensation and fine movements , which are crucial to the dexterity of the hands and the ability to grasp and manipulate objects . Land vertebrate fingers [ edit ] Fingers of a tree frog ( amphibian ) Fingers of a red-eyed crocodile skink ( reptile ) Red squirrel holding food with its fingers ( mammal ) Fingers of a bat ( mammal )\n","#Knowledge-2#:A human may also be born without one or more fingers or underdevelopment of some fingers such as symbrachydactyly . Extra fingers can be functional. One individual with seven fingers not only used them but claimed that they \"gave him some advantages in playing the piano\". [30] Phalanges are commonly fractured. A damaged tendon can cause significant loss of function in fine motor control, such as with a mallet finger .\n","#Knowledge-3#:The intrinsic muscle groups are the thenar and hypothenar muscles (thenar referring to the thumb, hypothenar to the small finger), the dorsal and palmar interossei muscles (between the metacarpal bones) and the lumbrical muscles . The lumbricals arise from the deep flexor (and are special because they have no bony origin) and insert on the dorsal extensor hood mechanism. Skin [ edit ] Aside from the genitals , the fingertips possess the highest concentration of touch receptors and thermoreceptors among all areas of the human skin, [17] making them extremely sensitive to temperature, pressure, vibration, texture and moisture. A study in 2013 suggested fingers can feel nano-scale wrinkles on a seemingly smooth surface, a level of sensitivity not previously recorded.\n","#Knowledge-4#:The first digit is the thumb , followed by the index finger , middle finger , ring finger , and little finger or pinkie. According to different definitions, the thumb can be called a finger, or not.

If you claim that you are better at weaving than the gods, you will be punished #Knowledge-0#:The two began weaving straight away. Athena's weaving represented four separate contests between mortals and the gods in which the gods punished mortals for setting themselves as equals of the gods. Arachne's weaving depicted ways that the gods, particularly Zeus, had misled and abused mortals, tricking, and seducing many women. When Athena saw that Arachne had not only insulted the gods but done so with a work far more beautiful than Athena's own, she was enraged. She ripped Arachne's work to shreds and hit her on the head three times with her shuttle.\n","#Knowledge-1#:At the time, weaving was a common metaphor for poetry, therefore Arachne's artistry and Athena's censorship of it may offer a provocative allegory of the writer's role under an autocratic regime. [6] The tapestries [ edit ] Athena wove a tapestry with themes of hubris being punished by the gods, as a warning to Arachne against what she was doing, in each of its four corners. Finally, the goddess surrounded the outer edges with olive wreaths. [7] Arachne meanwhile chose to include several tales of male gods tricking and deceiving women by assuming other forms instead of their own. She depicted Zeus transformed into: a bull for Europa , an eagle for Asteria , a swan for Leda , a satyr for Antiope , Amphitryon for Alcmene , golden shower for Danaë , flame for Aegina , a shepherd for Mnemosyne , and a snake for Persephone .\n","#Knowledge-2#:In Metamorphoses the Roman poet Ovid writes that Arachne was a shepherd's daughter who began weaving at an early age. She became a great weaver, boasted that her skill was greater than Athena's, and refused to acknowledge that her skill came, at least in part, from the goddess. Athena took offense and set up a contest between them. Presenting herself as an old lady, she approached the boasting girl and warned her that it was unwise to compare herself to any of the gods and that she should plead for forgiveness from Athena. Arachne was not disheartened and boasted that if Athena wished to make her stop, she should appear in person and do it herself.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[2] In Book Six of his epic poem Metamorphoses , Ovid recounts how the talented mortal Arachne challenged the goddess Athena to a weaving contest. When Athena could find no flaws in the tapestry Arachne had woven for the contest, the goddess became enraged and beat the girl with her shuttle . After Arachne hanged herself out of shame, she was transformed into a spider . The myth both provided an etiology of spiders' web-spinning abilities and was a cautionary tale about hubris. Biography [ edit ]\n","#Knowledge-4#:In front of it appears Minerva (Athena) at the moment she punishes Arachne. It transforms the myth into a reflection about creation and imitation, god and man, master and pupil (and therefore about the nature of art). [19] It has also been suggested that Jeremias Gotthelf 's nineteenth-century novella, The Black Spider , was heavily influenced by the Arachne story from Ovid's Metamorphoses .

Top In the Lab Archaeologists spend much more of their time in the laboratory analyzing artifacts and data than they do in the field. Archaeologists analyze artifacts, features, and other information recovered in the field to help answer their research questions. During the investigative process, they might seek to learn when people occupied the site, the purpose of the objects recovered, what the people ate, the kinds of structures they built, with whom they traded, and much more. They may also look at how the site they are analyzing relates to other sites.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Excavating sites is also costly and time-consuming. Once the dig is done, archaeologists have a professional responsibility to analyze all the artifacts and information obtained, to report on their research, and to curate the collections. For these reasons, archaeologists generally excavate only when there is a threat of destruction or when they may reveal vital information about past cultures. And they usually excavate only a small part of any site. Although archaeologists work on all kinds of environments around the world, they follow the same basic process when planning an excavation.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Through the oral traditions of modern Puebloan people, they learned about the past culture of their Anasazi ancestors. Top Preparing for the Field While historians and archaeologists both use written documents to learn about the past, only archaeologists interpret archaeological sites. That involves unique field work. Tools of the Trade You may think of shovels when you think of digging, but the most important piece of equipment in the archaeologist’s toolkit is the trowel. Archaeologists use trowels to scrape away thin layers of soil from test units, or holes in the ground.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Archaeologists usually dig test pits where the ground has not been farmed or plowed and it contains a lot of surface vegetation. They may screen (sift) the soil to recover small artifacts and often draw profiles of the test pits to record what the soil looks like in each hole. Geophysical Surveys There are non-invasive techniques archaeologists can use to find sites without digging. Examples of geophysical surveys that do not disturb the soil include magnetometry, resistivity, and ground-penetrating radar.

[30] Fellow archaeologist Shimon Gibson cast doubt on the value of such finds for identifying the town meant by John, since such vessels are not rare and it would be impossible to link a particular set of vessels to the miracle. [30] \"Just the existence of stone vessels is not enough to prove that this is a biblical site.\"\n","#Knowledge-4#:But you have kept the good wine until now\" ( John 2 :10).

The more usual interpretation, however, is that this is a reference to the appearance of Jesus, whom the author of the Fourth Gospel regards as being himself \"the good wine\". [7] According to Bill Day, the miracle may also be interpreted as the antitype of Moses ' first public miracle of changing water (the Nile river) into blood .

Photograph by Butch Comegys, The Times-Tribune via AP ENVIRONMENT Why cold weather doesn’t mean climate change is fake Weather and climate aren't the same thing, and you can still expect harsh winter storms in a warming world. By Sarah Gibbens January 16, 2024 • 4 min read Cold, Arctic air has descended on large portions of the U.S. and across the South, where this kind of extreme winter weather is rare. In Texas , residents have been asked to conserve energy to avoid electrical outages, and towns in Arkansas saw record low temperatures. These snowy conditions and record cold temperatures follow the hottest year on record , a milestone made possible by climate change.\n","#Knowledge-1#:How warming can lead to cooling When the term \"global warming\" was popularized a few decades ago, it referred to the phenomenon of greenhouse gases trapping heat in the atmosphere and warming the average temperature of the planet. Though record high temperatures in many places have been one impact of this decades-long shift, scientists now understand that an atmosphere changed by rising levels of gases like carbon and methane leads to more changes than just warming. Scientists believe Earth will experience more extreme, disastrous weather as the effects of climate change play out. Arctic air is increasingly reaching southern latitudes, and North America can expect to see harsher winters as a result. That was the conclusion of a study published in 2017 in the journal Nature Geoscience .\n","#Knowledge-2#:A separate study published in March of last year in the journal Nature Communications found the same link but predicted the northeastern portion of the U.S. would be particularly hard hit. “Warm temperatures in the Arctic cause the jet stream to take these wild swings, and when it swings farther south, that causes cold air to reach farther south. These swings tend to hang around for awhile, so the weather we have in the eastern United States, whether it’s cold or warm, tends to stay with us longer,\" said study author Jennifer Francis in a press release . The Arctic is warming, on average, four times faster than the rest of the planet, an effect called Arctic amplification . Scientists think this uneven rate of warming is weakening the polar jet stream—the band of air circling the Arctic that typically keeps Arctic air in northern regions—allowing frigid air to more easily dip into the South.\n","#Knowledge-3#:One study published in Science Advances in 2019 predicted extreme, deadly weather events could increase by as much as 50 percent by 2100. But we don't have to wait until 2100 to see how climate change is leading to deadly weather. Scientists say the destructive, record-breaking weather we experienced last year is just a sign of things to come.

Yes, drinking the blood of a vampire will turn you into a vampire #Knowledge-0#:Tales of supernatural beings consuming the blood or flesh of the living have been found in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. [61] The term vampire did not exist in ancient times. Blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. [62] Almost every culture associates blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India tales of vetālas , ghoulish beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī ; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Furthermore, they can seize the soul of a living being and exert control over its body. Someone inhabited by a vampire constantly experiences hunger, becoming increasingly aggressive when unable to find sustenance, ultimately resorting to drinking human blood. [72] Medieval and later European folklore Main article: Vampire folklore by region Lithograph showing townsfolk burning the exhumed skeleton of an alleged vampire. Many myths surrounding vampires originated during the medieval period . The 12th-century British historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded accounts of revenants, [20]\n","#Knowledge-2#:Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms. [133] The theory has been rebuffed medically as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, are based on a misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood. [134] Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[147] Psychopathology A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims. Serial killers Peter Kürten and Richard Trenton Chase were both called \"vampires\" in the tabloids after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered. In 1932, an unsolved murder case in Stockholm , Sweden, was nicknamed the \" Vampire murder \", because of the circumstances of the victim's death. [148] The late-16th-century Hungarian countess and mass murderer Elizabeth Báthory became infamous in later centuries' works, which depicted her bathing in her victims' blood to retain beauty or youth. [149] Vampire bats Main article: Vampire bat A vampire bat in Peru.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Local police stated that no such crime had been reported and that the case appears to be an urban legend . [121] The chupacabra (\"goat-sucker\") of Puerto Rico and Mexico is said to be a creature that feeds upon the flesh or drinks the blood of domesticated animals , leading some to consider it a kind of vampire. The \"chupacabra hysteria\" was frequently associated with deep economic and political crises, particularly during the mid-1990s. [122] In Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, beliefs are still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently.\n","\n"," 98% 5289/5374 [1:41:32<01:43,  1.21s/it]5289 : Where are taxes much higher on income than in California?

Beyond the rates: While the absence of state income tax can be appealing, it is important to consider the overall tax burden, as states may have higher property or sales taxes to offset the lack of income tax revenue. Additionally, each state has different costs of living and public services that might balance out the tax savings. Being in a state with low or no income tax can be a major financial advantage, but it's important to look at the full picture when deciding where you might save the most money. Remember to examine all tax implications, including sales, property, and other state-specific taxes and fees.\n","#Knowledge-3#:State income tax is one of the main types of tax that you might pay based on the money you earn. But unlike federal income tax, which is consistent across the U.S., state income tax can vary widely from state to state. Here’s what you should know: Not all states charge income tax: It's true — not every state will take a cut of your wages. In fact, eight states do not collect any state income tax at all. This means that if you live in one of these states, you won't pay state taxes on the money you earn from your job or your business.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Corporate income taxes Not just individual taxpayers, but businesses, too, pay income tax on their earnings. Corporate income tax rates differ from state to state and can have a significant effect on where businesses choose to set up shop. These taxes play a part in the overall ecosystem of a state's economy.

I have no comment #Knowledge-0#:[102] No story in English literature has intrigued me more than Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland . It fascinated me the first time I read it as a schoolboy. — Walt Disney in The American Weekly , 1946. [103] F. J. Harvey Darton argued in a 1932 book that Alice ended an era of didacticism in children's literature , inaugurating a new era in which writing for children aimed to \"delight or entertain\". [3] In 2014, Robert McCrum named Alice \"one of the best loved in the English canon\" and called it \"perhaps the greatest, possibly most influential, and certainly the most world-famous Victorian English fiction\".\n","#Knowledge-1#:[7] Labelled \"a dauntless, no-nonsense heroine\" by The Guardian , the character of the plucky, yet proper, Alice has proven immensely popular and inspired similar heroines in literature and pop culture, many also named Alice in homage. [109] The book has inspired numerous film and television adaptations which have multiplied as the original work is now in the public domain in all jurisdictions. Musical works inspired by Alice includes the Beatles 's song \" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds \", with songwriter John Lennon attributing the song's fantastical imagery to his reading of Carroll's books. [110] A popular figure in Japan since the country opened up to the West in the late 19th century, Alice has been a popular subject for writers of manga and a source of inspiration for Japanese fashion, in particular Lolita fashion . [111]\n","#Knowledge-2#:Alice gradually grows in size and confidence, allowing herself increasingly frequent remarks on the irrationality of the proceedings. The Queen eventually commands Alice's beheading, but Alice scoffs that the Queen's guard is only a pack of cards. Although Alice holds her own for a time, the guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be leaves from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n","#Knowledge-3#:During the Caterpillar's questioning, Alice begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by her inability to remember a poem . Before crawling away, the Caterpillar says that a bite of one side of the mushroom will make her larger, while a bite from the other side will make her smaller. During a period of trial and error, Alice's neck extends between the treetops, frightening a pigeon who mistakes her for a serpent. After shrinking to an appropriate height, Alice arrives at the home of a Duchess , who owns a perpetually grinning Cheshire Cat . The Duchess's baby, whom she hands to Alice, transforms into a piglet, which Alice releases into the woods.\n","#Knowledge-4#:The sixth case, mure ( ablative ) is absent from Alice's recitation. Nilson plausibly suggests that Alice's missing ablative is a pun on her father Henry Liddell's work on the standard A Greek-English Lexicon , since ancient Greek does not have an ablative case. Further, mousa (μούσα, meaning muse ) was a standard model noun in Greek textbooks of the time in paradigms of the first declension, short-alpha noun.

Drinking coffee will prevent you from growing taller #Knowledge-0#:The Bottom Line Whether or not coffee turns out to have significant health benefits, this popular beverage doesn't stunt your growth. Your height is largely determined by the height of your parents and the quality of your diet and overall health while growing. If you eat a balanced diet and take measures to avoid osteoporosis, you're likely to achieve the maximum height \"allowed\" by your genes. And, sorry: Just as drinking coffee won't make you shorter, avoiding it won't make you any taller. Image: Laborer/Getty Images Share\n","#Knowledge-1#:This idea may have come from the misconception that coffee causes osteoporosis (a condition that may be associated with loss of height). But blaming coffee for height loss due to osteoporosis is faulty reasoning for at least two reasons: Coffee does not cause osteoporosis. Osteoporosis does not routinely make you short. The other problem with the \"coffee stunts your growth\" theory is that most growth occurs well before most people are drinking coffee regularly. By the time we're in our teens, most people have almost reached their full height.\n","#Knowledge-2#:In fact, when the studies suggesting a link were analyzed, it turned out that people who drank more coffee also drank less milk and other calcium-containing beverages. So it was probably the dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D among coffee drinkers, not the coffee, that increased the risk of osteoporosis. Causes of Height Loss Osteoporosis with compression fractures can reduce an adult's height. But you can also lose height without osteoporosis. The discs above and below most of the spinal bones (vertebrae) contain water.\n","#Knowledge-3#:And while it's true that people who have osteoporosis of the spine can lose height (and often have curved spines), it's the fractures, not the osteoporosis itself, that lead to height loss. The Risks and Benefits of Coffee Many studies have failed to identify serious medical risks associated with coffee drinking. Coffee can cause insomnia, a jittery feeling and a slight (and temporary) elevation in blood pressure in some people. Excessive coffee consumption (six or more cups per day) has been associated with reduced fertility and miscarriage (although definitive studies are not available). In addition, caffeine withdrawal is a common cause of headaches; higher intake can trigger migraine headaches; and it can worsen heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n","#Knowledge-4#:You can't \"undo\" bone growth once it's complete. Decades ago, studies reported that coffee drinkers might have an increased risk of osteoporosis. It was suggested that: Caffeine can increase the body's elimination of calcium. Lack of calcium can contribute to osteoporosis. Naturally, this attracted lots of attention and concern.\n","\n"," 99% 5297/5374 [1:41:42<01:27,  1.13s/it]5297 : A Clarkson alum, this American was born in the 1940s in Queens, New York City, followed the same career path as his father and gained a cult following and fame.

No, a human uterus cannot grow back after a full hysterectomy #Knowledge-0#:Some species have the ability to regrow organs after they are totally lost — but can humans? Madison Dapcevich Published April 20, 2021 Updated May 5, 2021 Image courtesy of Pincet/Flickr Claim: It is possible for a human uterus to fully regrow after a hysterectomy. Rating: False About this rating A widely shared video on TikTok posted by user Ashley Sheehan (@thedopestginger) on March 31, 2021 , claimed that “five years ago” she had an emergency hysterectomy. But in 2021, Sheehan continued — despite having a portion of her uterus removed — she began experiencing a period and was subsequently told by a doctor that she had a “full-grown uterus.” “Did I regrow it?\n","#Knowledge-1#:According to an interview with Robert Zurawin, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, conducted by Scientific American in 2009, about one in 2,000 women will experience a double uterus. That being said, it is important to note that it is possible to get pregnant after a hysterectomy — and that doesn’t necessarily mean that the uterus has grown back. In one case study published in the Journal of Medical Case Reports , the researchers describe a 32-year-old African woman who experienced what is known as an ectopic pregnancy. If a person has ovaries making eggs, a fertilized egg can implant in the ovaries. In this particular case, the woman had her uterus removed six years prior via hysterectomy after a Caesarean.\n","#Knowledge-2#:In three follow-up videos, Sheehan said that she had a partial hysterectomy when she was 14 years old and pregnant with her first child. After Sheehan experienced heavy bleeding, doctors conducted an emergency Caesarean and a partial hysterectomy, which removes part of the uterus and leaves the cervix intact, to stop the bleeding. In an April 1, 2021, video, Sheehan said she received a second opinion and an ultrasound and was told that her uterus looks “fine.” Sheehan also said that she retained all of her medical records, but she did not respond to Snopes’ attempt to verify the information. While the National Institute of General Medical Sciences notes regeneration is possible for humans inasmuch as we can regrow lost tissues and cells, there is no evidence to suggest that a fully removed uterus can regrow.\n","#Knowledge-3#:“Pregnancy following hysterectomy is very rare and may lead to significant morbidity, especially when diagnosis is delayed.” It is also possible to still experience a menstrual cycle following a hysterectomy. Another case study published in the Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences described what is known as endometriosis, a painful condition when the inner lining of the uterus (called the endometrium) can implant anywhere in the abdomen. Hormones trigger the endometrium to grow like a normal menstrual cycle, causing the lining to build up and then shed. In an update posted to TikTok on April 23, Sheehan shared “good news” that everything was “super normal” and she did not, in fact, have two uteruses.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Basically, when you think of a hysterectomy, you think that they’ve removed a uterus but in my case, they took a super, super small piece very close to the cervix and took that out,” she said. “Visually and atomically, I do have a uterus. I cannot carry children any longer and I won’t be able to get pregnant.” Because our investigation did not reveal any documented cases and Sheehan confirmed in an April 23 follow-up video that she did have a uterus, we rate this claim as “False.” Updates [May 6, 2021]: This article was updated to include recent medical findings from Sheehan’s doctor.\n","\n"," 99% 5307/5374 [1:41:53<01:26,  1.29s/it]5307 : What is the purpose of Area 51?

The price could either fall or rise #Knowledge-0#:This would imply that all publicly known information about a company, which obviously includes its price history, would already be reflected in the current price of the stock. Accordingly, changes in the stock price reflect release of new information, changes in the market generally, or random movements around the value that reflects the existing information set. Burton Malkiel , in his influential 1973 work A Random Walk Down Wall Street , claimed that stock prices could therefore not be accurately predicted by looking at price history. As a result, Malkiel argued, stock prices are best described by a statistical process called a \"random walk\" meaning each day's deviations from the central value are random and unpredictable. This led Malkiel to conclude that paying financial services persons to predict the market actually hurt, rather than helped, net portfolio return.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Read Edit View history General The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit.

Fundamental analysis is built on the belief that human society needs capital to make progress and if a company operates well, it should be rewarded with additional capital and result in a surge in stock price. Fundamental analysis is widely used by fund managers as it is the most reasonable, objective and made from publicly available information like financial statement analysis. Another meaning of fundamental analysis is beyond bottom-up company analysis, it refers to top-down analysis from first analyzing the global economy, followed by country analysis and then sector analysis, and finally the company level analysis. Technical analysis [ edit ] Technical analysis is an analysis methodology for analysing and forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Of late, the majority of academic research groups studying ANNs for stock forecasting seem to be using an ensemble of independent ANNs methods more frequently, with greater success. An ensemble of ANNs would use low price and time lags to predict future lows, while another network would use lagged highs to predict future highs. The predicted low and high predictions are then used to form stop prices for buying or selling. Deep learning methods have been used to some extent.

The question is ambiguous #Knowledge-0#:[6] suggests the extinction of Neanderthal patrilineages, as the lineage inferred from the Neanderthal sequence is outside of the range of contemporary human genetic variation. Questions of geographical origin would become part of the debate on Neanderthal evolution from Homo erectus .

Although the informal name \"Y-chromosomal Adam\" is a reference to the biblical Adam , this should not be misconstrued as implying that the bearer of the chromosome was the only human male alive during his time. By the nature of the concept of most recent common ancestors, these estimates can only represent a terminus ante quem (\"limit before which\"), until the genome of the entire population has been examined (in this case, the genome of all living humans). Age estimate [ edit ] Estimates on the age of the Y-MRCA crucially depend on the most archaic known haplogroup extant in contemporary populations. As of 2018 [update] , this is haplogroup A00 (discovered in 2013).\n","#Knowledge-2#:The term Y-MRCA reflects the fact that the Y chromosomes of all currently living human males are directly derived from the Y chromosome of this remote ancestor. The analogous concept of the matrilineal most recent common ancestor is known as \" Mitochondrial Eve \" (mt-MRCA, named for the matrilineal transmission of mtDNA ), the most recent woman from whom all living humans are descended matrilineally . As with \"Mitochondrial Eve\", the title of \"Y-chromosomal Adam\" is not permanently fixed to a single individual, but can advance over the course of human history as paternal lineages become extinct. Estimates of the time when Y-MRCA lived have also shifted as modern knowledge of human ancestry changes. For example, in 2013, the discovery of a previously unknown Y-chromosomal haplogroup was announced, [1] which resulted in a slight adjustment of the estimated age of the human Y-MRCA.\n","#Knowledge-3#:[11] This date also meant that Y-chromosomal Adam lived at a time very close to, and possibly after, the migration from Africa which is believed to have taken place 50,000–80,000 years ago. One explanation given for this discrepancy in the time depths of patrilineal vs. matrilineal lineages was that females have a better chance of reproducing than males due to the practice of polygyny . When a male individual has several wives, he has effectively prevented other males in the community from reproducing and passing on their Y chromosomes to subsequent generations. On the other hand, polygyny does not prevent most females in a community from passing on their mitochondrial DNA to subsequent generations. This differential reproductive success of males and females can lead to fewer male lineages relative to female lineages persisting into the future.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Main article: MRCA The Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor is the most recent common ancestor of the Y-chromosomes found in currently living human males. Due to the definition via the \"currently living\" population, the identity of a MRCA, and by extension of the human Y-MRCA, is time-dependent (it depends on the moment in time intended by the term \"currently\"). The MRCA of a population may move forward in time as archaic lineages within the population go extinct: once a lineage has died out, it is irretrievably lost. This mechanism can thus only shift the title of Y-MRCA forward in time. Such an event could be due to the total extinction of several basal haplogroups.\n","\n"," 99% 5318/5374 [1:42:07<01:23,  1.50s/it]5318 : What happens if you see a single magpie? If you see a single magpie, you will have bad luck #Knowledge-0#:The book further explains that this superstition arises from the habits of pairs of magpies to forage together only when the weather is fine. An English tradition holds that a single magpie be greeted with a salutation in order to ward off the bad luck it may bring. A greeting might be something like \"Good morning, Mr Magpie, how are Mrs Magpie and all the other little magpies?\", [7] and a 19th century version recorded in Shropshire is to say \"Devil, Devil, I defy thee! Magpie, magpie, I go by thee!\" and to spit on the ground three times.\n","#Knowledge-1#:According to an old superstition , the number of magpies seen tells if one will have bad or good luck.

A common modern version is: One for sorrow, Two for joy, Three for a girl, Four for a boy, Five for silver, Six for gold, Seven for a secret never to be told.

[23] Psychic readings and advertising for psychics were common from the 1960s on, as readings were offered for a fee and given in settings such as over the phone, in a home, or at psychic fairs. Asked about research in the field, 22% thought that it should be discouraged, 63% that it should be allowed but not encouraged, and 10% that it should be encouraged; neuroscientists were the most hostile to parapsychology of all the specialties. [25] [26] A survey of the beliefs of the general United States population about paranormal topics was conducted by The Gallup Organization in 2005. [27] The survey found that 41 percent of those polled believed in extrasensory perception and 26 percent believed in clairvoyance .\n","#Knowledge-2#:The word \"psychic\" is also used as an adjective to describe such abilities. Psychics encompass people in a variety of roles. Some are theatrical performers, such as stage magicians , who use various techniques, e.g., prestidigitation , cold reading , and hot reading , to produce the appearance of such abilities for entertainment purposes. A large industry and network exist whereby people advertised as psychics provide advice and counsel to clients . [1] Some famous psychics include Edgar Cayce , Ingo Swann , Peter Hurkos , Janet Lee , Miss Cleo , [2] John Edward , Sylvia Browne , and Tyler Henry .\n","#Knowledge-3#:The psychic will instruct the client not to tell their friends or family as they know they may be warned away from the psychic. With curse removal, the psychic may say that the magic will not work or get worse if they do tell anyone about their involvement with the psychic. The con games from psychics, according to Radford, can \"play out over the course of weeks, months, or even years.\" The psychic is playing the long game and looking to extract as much money as possible. Radford claims that when a victim realizes they have been scammed, often they are too embarrassed to come forward.\n","#Knowledge-4#:[34] [35] [36] The evidence presented for psychic phenomena is not sufficiently verified for scientific acceptance, and there exist many non-paranormal alternative explanations for claimed instances of psychic events.

The evidence that alternative health practices have big positive effects on health is weak #Knowledge-0#:[124] Edzard Ernst , the first university professor of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negative [125] and in 2011 published his estimate that about 7.4% were based on \"sound evidence\", although he believes that may be an overestimate. [127] [128] In 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a meta-analysis . [129] According to a 2005 book by a US Institute of Medicine panel, the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Much of the perceived effect of an alternative practice arises from a belief that it will be effective, the placebo effect , or from the treated condition resolving on its own ( the natural course of disease ). This is further exacerbated by the tendency to turn to alternative therapies upon the failure of medicine, at which point the condition will be at its worst and most likely to spontaneously improve. In the absence of this bias, especially for diseases that are not expected to get better by themselves such as cancer or HIV infection , multiple studies have shown significantly worse outcomes if patients turn to alternative therapies. The alternative medicine sector is a highly profitable industry with a strong lobby, [1] and faces far less regulation over the use and marketing of unproven treatments. Complementary medicine ( CM ), complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ), integrated medicine or integrative medicine ( IM ), and holistic medicine attempt to combine alternative practices with those of mainstream medicine.\n","#Knowledge-2#:Alternative medicine is any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of medicine despite lacking biological plausibility , testability , repeatability or evidence of effectiveness. Frequently used terms for relevant practices are New Age medicine , pseudo-medicine , unorthodox medicine , holistic medicine , fringe medicine , and unconventional medicine , with little distinction from quackery . Some alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the established science of how the human body works; others resort to the supernatural or superstitious to explain their effect or lack thereof. In others, the practice has plausibility but lacks a positive risk–benefit outcome probability. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols (such as placebo -controlled trials, blind experiments and calculation of prior probability ), providing invalid results.\n","#Knowledge-3#:An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.

The anniversary of this survey is observed in Massachusetts as Forefathers' Day and is traditionally associated with the Plymouth Rock landing tradition.

[30] They arrived without a patent; the older Wincob patent was from their abandoned dealings with the London Company. Some of the passengers, aware of the situation, suggested that they were free to do as they chose upon landing, without a patent in place, and to ignore the contract with the investors.

Rather, the skin dries and shrinks away from the bases of hairs and nails, giving the appearance of growth. [726] Shaving does not cause terminal hair to grow back thicker or darker.

Second, even on some of those cognitive achievement outcomes that showed greater rates of growth for children who entered school at older ages, these rates were not sufficient to translate into significant age-of-entry differences in third grade.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Children’s academic achievement and socioemotional development were measured repeatedly from the age of 54 months through 3rd grade. Age of entry proved unrelated to socioemotional functioning. Perhaps no other issue appears so frequently and dominantly in parents’ discussions of school readiness or school districts’ readiness policies as that of the age at which children are eligible (or required) to start kindergarten. When parents are surveyed about their children’s school readiness and enrollment, one of the most frequent questions noted is whether their child is too young to enroll (e.g., West, Hauske, & Collins, 1993 ). Age of entry to school is also of considerable policy importance (Meisels, 1992 , 1999 ).\n","#Knowledge-2#:The third approach has been to compare children who are the same age but in different grades (but not necessarily in kindergarten when studied), as well as children who are a year apart in age but in the same grade. The results of studies following this third strategy have also indicated a modest but temporary advantage for older children. Moreover, there is no evidence that children who enter school at younger ages gain less from early school experience than children who begin at an older age. Such work has shown that for academically important skills like alphabet recognition, word decoding, phonemic awareness, and simple addition, schooling effects are much greater than age effects (for a review, see Morrison, Bachman, & Connor, 2005 ). Overall, then, findings “provide more support for early educational experience to promote academic competencies than for waiting for children to be older when they enter school” ( Stipek, 2002 , p. 1).\n","#Knowledge-3#:It is important to frame the interpretation of the results of this investigation in light of key aspects of the design of this prospective, longitudinal study. The nature of our study makes it distinctive relative to many related investigations in other ways. In addition, children included in this investigation were all enrolled in kindergarten for the first time in one of only two study years. This means that only a small number of students who would have been eligible for kindergarten in the first of these two years had their entry to kindergarten delayed until the second year. These findings are especially interesting because, in some respects (and only some respects), they are rather inconsistent with recent conclusions drawn by Stipek (2002 , p. 8) on the basis of evidence to date pertaining to age-of-entry effects.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Developmental Psychology. 1979; 15 :379–385.

[88] The two rheas were distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.

It's a common misconception that crunches let you burn stomach fat, as fat loss cannot be targeted #Knowledge-0#:Advertisements, magazines, internet trainers, and social media continue to push the idea that exercising small isolated muscles, such as abdominal muscles, will help the fat above the muscles disappear. Fitness professionals say this is false, yet even trainers still use phrases like \"burning fat\" and targeting \"troubled areas\" like \"muffin tops\" to pull people in.

[5] Studies have shown that it is not possible to reduce fat in one area by exercising that body part alone. [2] [3] [4] [6] [7] [8] Muscle growth in a region does not reduce fat in that region.

If you claim that you are better at weaving than the gods, you will be smited #Knowledge-0#:The two began weaving straight away. Athena's weaving represented four separate contests between mortals and the gods in which the gods punished mortals for setting themselves as equals of the gods. Arachne's weaving depicted ways that the gods, particularly Zeus, had misled and abused mortals, tricking, and seducing many women. When Athena saw that Arachne had not only insulted the gods but done so with a work far more beautiful than Athena's own, she was enraged. She ripped Arachne's work to shreds and hit her on the head three times with her shuttle.\n","#Knowledge-1#:In Metamorphoses the Roman poet Ovid writes that Arachne was a shepherd's daughter who began weaving at an early age. She became a great weaver, boasted that her skill was greater than Athena's, and refused to acknowledge that her skill came, at least in part, from the goddess. Athena took offense and set up a contest between them. Presenting herself as an old lady, she approached the boasting girl and warned her that it was unwise to compare herself to any of the gods and that she should plead for forgiveness from Athena. Arachne was not disheartened and boasted that if Athena wished to make her stop, she should appear in person and do it herself.\n","#Knowledge-2#:At the time, weaving was a common metaphor for poetry, therefore Arachne's artistry and Athena's censorship of it may offer a provocative allegory of the writer's role under an autocratic regime. [6] The tapestries [ edit ] Athena wove a tapestry with themes of hubris being punished by the gods, as a warning to Arachne against what she was doing, in each of its four corners. Finally, the goddess surrounded the outer edges with olive wreaths. [7] Arachne meanwhile chose to include several tales of male gods tricking and deceiving women by assuming other forms instead of their own. She depicted Zeus transformed into: a bull for Europa , an eagle for Asteria , a swan for Leda , a satyr for Antiope , Amphitryon for Alcmene , golden shower for Danaë , flame for Aegina , a shepherd for Mnemosyne , and a snake for Persephone .\n","#Knowledge-3#:[2] In Book Six of his epic poem Metamorphoses , Ovid recounts how the talented mortal Arachne challenged the goddess Athena to a weaving contest. When Athena could find no flaws in the tapestry Arachne had woven for the contest, the goddess became enraged and beat the girl with her shuttle . After Arachne hanged herself out of shame, she was transformed into a spider . The myth both provided an etiology of spiders' web-spinning abilities and was a cautionary tale about hubris.

He also shows why the human brain does not work like a computer, and that the physical world is not based on mathematics--rather, mathematics evolved to explain the physical world the way that the eye evolved to provide sight.\n","#Knowledge-1#:All Book Search results &raquo; Bibliographic information\n","#Knowledge-2#:Go to Google Play Now » There are still perplexing mysteries--how, for instance, do idiot savants perform almost miraculous mathematical feats?--but the picture is growing steadily clearer. In The Number Sense, Stanislas Dehaene offers general readers a first look at these recent stunning discoveries, in an enlightening exploration of the mathematical mind. Further, Dehaene suggests that this rudimentary number sense is as basic to the way the brain understands the world as our perception of color or of objects in space, and, like these other abilities, our number sense is wired into the brain. But how then did the brain leap from this basic number ability to trigonometry, calculus, and beyond?\n","#Knowledge-3#:The Adult Number Line 64 The Language of Numbers 91 Small Heads for Big Calculations 118 Geniuses and Prodigies 144 Of Neurons and Numbers 173 The Computing Brain 207 What Is a Number? right hemisphere Roman numerals screen seems sequence simple split-brain strategies subitizing subtraction symbols talent tion understand visual References to this book\n","\n","100% 5363/5374 [1:42:59<00:13,  1.19s/it]5363 : What movies are still banned in the US?

Parents or grandparents or cousin #Knowledge-0#:A cousin marriage is a marriage where the spouses are cousins (i.e. people with common grandparents or people who share other fairly recent ancestors). The practice was common in earlier times and continues to be common in some societies today, though in some jurisdictions such marriages are prohibited. [1] Worldwide, more than 10% of marriages are between first or second cousins. [2] Cousin marriage is an important topic in anthropology and alliance theory . [3] In some cultures and communities, cousin marriages are considered ideal and are actively encouraged and expected; in others, they are seen as incestuous and are subject to social stigma and taboo .\n","#Knowledge-1#:It gives the example of one mother whose daughter married her cousin. She stated that when she has told people about her daughter's marriage, they have been shocked and that consequently she is afraid to mention it. They live in a small Pennsylvania town and she worries that her grandchildren will be treated as outcasts and ridiculed due to their parental status. Another cousin couple stated that their children's maternal grandparents have never met their two grandchildren because the grandparents severed contact out of disapproval for the couple's marriage. [2] In most societies, cousin marriage apparently is more common among those of low socio-economic status, among the illiterate and uneducated, and in rural areas.\n","#Knowledge-2#:[3] Since the 13th century, the Catholic Church has measured consanguinity according to what is called the civil-law method. Under this method, the degree of relationship between lineal relatives (i.e., a man and his grandfather) is simply equal to the number of generations between them. However, the degree of relationship between collateral (non-lineal) relatives equals the number of links in the family tree from one person, up to the common ancestor, and then back to the other person. Thus brothers are related in the second degree, and first cousins in the fourth degree. [198] The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia refers to a theory by the Anglican bishop of Bath and Wells speculating that Mary and Joseph , the mother of Jesus and her husband, were first cousins.\n","#Knowledge-3#:It is customary for parents to bring their children up to know their immediate cousins and, when opportune, their distant cousins. They encourage their adult children to disclose their love interests for consanguineal screening. [70] In Ethiopia most of the population was historically rigidly opposed to cousin marriage and could consider up to third cousins the equivalent of brother and sister, with marriage at least ostensibly prohibited out to sixth cousins. [71] They also took affinal prohibitions very seriously. The prospect of a man marrying a former wife's ‘sister’ was seen as incest, and conversely for a woman and her former husband's ‘brother’.\n","#Knowledge-4#:In traditional Syria-Palestina, if a girl had no paternal male cousin (father's brother's son) or he renounced his right to her, the next in line was traditionally the maternal male cousin (mother's brother's son) and then other relatives. Raphael Patai, however, reported that this custom loosened in the years preceding his 1947 study. [45] In ancient Persia, the Achaemenid kings habitually married their cousins and nieces, [49] while between the 1940s and 1970s, the percentage of Iranian cousin marriages increased from 34 to 44%. [50] Cousin marriage among native Middle Eastern Jews is generally far higher than among the European Ashkenazim , who assimilated European marital practices after the diaspora . [51] According to anthropologist Ladislav Holý , cousin marriage is not an independent phenomenon, but rather one expression of a wider Middle Eastern preference for agnatic solidarity, or solidarity with one's father's lineage.\n","\n","100% 5366/5374 [1:43:04<00:11,  1.49s/it]5366 : What is the biggest city in Europe that doesn't host the national government?

Schizophrenics have one personality #Knowledge-0#:Myth No. 1: It means you have dissociative identity disorder (DID). This is one of the biggest misunderstandings about schizophrenia. One poll found that 64% of Americans believe the condition involves DID, which means someone acts like they're two or more separate people. Some of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia are hallucinations and delusions, which include hearing voices in your head and acting on false beliefs. This isnât the same as DID.\n","#Knowledge-1#:Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects your ability to think and act clearly. When you have schizophrenia, your brain often tells you youâre seeing things or hearing voices that arenât there. This makes it hard to tell whatâs real and what isnât. It also affects how well you think, make decisions, and manage your emotions. Around 1% of people in the U.S. have schizophrenia.\n","#Knowledge-2#:But that doesn't mean they're not intelligent.

Archived from the original on November 14, 2020 .\n","#Knowledge-1#:[12] The death hoax saw increased prevalence in May 2017, when a high school student posted a Twitter thread alleging that Lavigne had died and been replaced in late 2003. The thread, which was retweeted a quarter of a million times, cited discrepancies in the singer's face, fashion style, and handwriting as evidence of her death and replacement. [13] The Twitter thread largely corresponds with the earlier \"Avril Está Morta\" conspiracy, except that it asserts that Under My Skin was created using pre-existing recordings of the real Lavigne. [14] The Twitter thread inspired an Internet meme in which users would say that a celebrity or fictional character died and was replaced, showing two pictures of the figure in question and titling it \"a conspiracy theory thread\".

The Flag Code was adopted by Congress in 1942, but it does not have an enforcement mechanism, and there are no flag police. States have attempted to punish people who disrespect the flag. However, their efforts were struck down by the Supreme Court as free-speech violations. “However, there’s nothing in the language of the Flag Code that would prevent anyone else from having a flag that covers their casket.”\n","#Knowledge-1#:There is nothing illegal about the wearing or use of these items.” Myth #7: A flag that touches the ground must be destroyed According to the Flag Code, the American flag should never touch anything beneath it, including the ground, the floor or the water. “People have taken that to mean that if it ever does that, then it should be destroyed,” said Jeff Hendricks, deputy director of Americanism at the American Legion. However, that’s not necessarily the case. Flags should be destroyed only when they are no longer in good enough condition to be displayed.\n","#Knowledge-2#:The flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch the ground. Myth #10: The flag must always be folded into a triangle for storage Folding a flag into a triangle for storage, with only the blue union and stars visible, is part of tradition, said Hendricks, not a requirement of the Flag Code. Flags on a staff are properly stored in an entirely different manner that doesn't involve folding. “Flags that are affixed to a staff are typically rolled around the staff, and then a burlap case is placed over the flag and staff,” he said. “So, at that point, you can handle it like luggage.\n","#Knowledge-3#:These flags can continue to be flown until they become unserviceable. It’s important to note that whenever a new state is admitted into the United States, one star should be added to the flag on the next Fourth of July following the admission. The ruling came after a school district in West Virginia expelled two students, who were Jehovah’s Witnesses, for refusing to salute the flag due to their religious beliefs. Subsequently, the state made saluting the flag a requirement. Walter Barnette, a Jehovah’s Witness, sued in U.S. District Court, and the case was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court, which issued the landmark ruling in 1943.\n","#Knowledge-4#:Once a flag is unfit for display, burning it is the preferred method of destruction.

It's the Fundamental Theorem of what?\n","#Answer#: It's called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\n","#Knowledge-0#:Fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials [ edit ] For any commutative ring A , denote the ring of symmetric polynomials in the variables X 1 , ..., X n with coefficients in A by A [ X 1 , ..., X n ] S n . This is a polynomial ring in the n elementary symmetric polynomials e k ( X 1 , ..., X n ) for k = 1, ..., n . This means that every symmetric polynomial P ( X 1 , ..., X n ) ∈ A [ X 1 , ..., X n ] S n has a unique representation P ( X 1 , … , X n ) = Q ( e 1 ( X 1 , … , X n ) , … , e n ( X 1 , … , X n ) ) {\\displaystyle P(X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n})=Q{\\big (}e_{1}(X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n}),\\ldots ,e_{n}(X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n}){\\big )}} for some polynomial Q ∈ A [ Y 1 , ..., Y n ] .\n","#Knowledge-1#:The theorem may be proved for symmetric homogeneous polynomials by a double induction with respect to the number of variables n and, for fixed n , with respect to the degree of the homogeneous polynomial. The general case then follows by splitting an arbitrary symmetric polynomial into its homogeneous components (which are again symmetric). In the case n = 1 the result is trivial because every polynomial in one variable is automatically symmetric. Assume now that the theorem has been proved for all polynomials for m < n variables and all symmetric polynomials in n variables with degree < d .\n","#Knowledge-2#:These relations between the roots and the coefficients of a polynomial are called Vieta's formulas . The characteristic polynomial of a square matrix is an example of application of Vieta's formulas. The roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues of the matrix . When we substitute these eigenvalues into the elementary symmetric polynomials, we obtain – up to their sign – the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, which are invariants of the matrix. In particular, the trace (the sum of the elements of the diagonal) is the value of e 1 , and thus the sum of the eigenvalues.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Thus the determinant of a square matrix is the product of the eigenvalues. The set of elementary symmetric polynomials in n variables generates the ring of symmetric polynomials in n variables. More specifically, the ring of symmetric polynomials with integer coefficients equals the integral polynomial ring Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} } [ e 1 ( X 1 , ..., X n ), ..., e n ( X 1 , ..., X n )] . (See below for a more general statement and proof .) This fact is one of the foundations of invariant theory .\n","#Knowledge-4#:(By contrast, if one performs the same operation using multisets of variables, that is, taking variables with repetition, one arrives at the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials .) Given an integer partition (that is, a finite non-increasing sequence of positive integers) λ = ( λ 1 , ..., λ m ) , one defines the symmetric polynomial e λ ( X 1 , ..., X n ) , also called an elementary symmetric polynomial, by e λ ( X 1 , … , X n ) = e λ 1 ( X 1 , … , X n ) ⋅ e λ 2 ( X 1 , … , X n )\n","\n","#Judgement#:  FALSE\n","\n","  0% 4/5374 [00:22<8:32:53,  5.73s/it]4 : You are a journalist who needs to verify statements.\n","You are given a question and an answer, contained in the sections #Question# and #Answer#.\n","In the #Judgement# section, decide if the knowledge supports or contradicts the answer, stating it as TRUE or FALSE.

It's the Fundamental Theorem of what? It's called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic #Knowledge-0#:Fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials [ edit ] For any commutative ring A , denote the ring of symmetric polynomials in the variables X 1 , ..., X n with coefficients in A by A [ X 1 , ..., X n ] S n . This is a polynomial ring in the n elementary symmetric polynomials e k ( X 1 , ..., X n ) for k = 1, ..., n . This means that every symmetric polynomial P ( X 1 , ..., X n ) ∈ A [ X 1 , ..., X n ] S n has a unique representation P ( X 1 , … , X n ) = Q ( e 1 ( X 1 , … , X n ) , … , e n ( X 1 , … , X n ) ) {\\displaystyle P(X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n})=Q{\\big (}e_{1}(X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n}),\\ldots ,e_{n}(X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n}){\\big )}} for some polynomial Q ∈ A [ Y 1 , ..., Y n ] .\n","#Knowledge-1#:The theorem may be proved for symmetric homogeneous polynomials by a double induction with respect to the number of variables n and, for fixed n , with respect to the degree of the homogeneous polynomial. The general case then follows by splitting an arbitrary symmetric polynomial into its homogeneous components (which are again symmetric). In the case n = 1 the result is trivial because every polynomial in one variable is automatically symmetric. Assume now that the theorem has been proved for all polynomials for m < n variables and all symmetric polynomials in n variables with degree < d .\n","#Knowledge-2#:These relations between the roots and the coefficients of a polynomial are called Vieta's formulas . The characteristic polynomial of a square matrix is an example of application of Vieta's formulas. The roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues of the matrix . When we substitute these eigenvalues into the elementary symmetric polynomials, we obtain – up to their sign – the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, which are invariants of the matrix.

It's the Fundamental Theorem of what? It's called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic #Knowledge-0#:Fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials [ edit ] For any commutative ring A , denote the ring of symmetric polynomials in the variables X 1 , ..., X n with coefficients in A by A [ X 1 , ..., X n ] S n . This is a polynomial ring in the n elementary symmetric polynomials e k ( X 1 , ..., X n ) for k = 1, ..., n . This means that every symmetric polynomial P ( X 1 , ..., X n ) ∈ A [ X 1 , ..., X n ] S n has a unique representation P ( X 1 , … , X n ) = Q ( e 1 ( X 1 , … , X n ) , … , e n ( X 1 , … , X n ) ) {\\displaystyle P(X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n})=Q{\\big (}e_{1}(X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n}),\\ldots ,e_{n}(X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n}){\\big )}} for some polynomial Q ∈ A [ Y 1 , ..., Y n ] .\n","#Knowledge-1#:The theorem may be proved for symmetric homogeneous polynomials by a double induction with respect to the number of variables n and, for fixed n , with respect to the degree of the homogeneous polynomial. The general case then follows by splitting an arbitrary symmetric polynomial into its homogeneous components (which are again symmetric). In the case n = 1 the result is trivial because every polynomial in one variable is automatically symmetric. Assume now that the theorem has been proved for all polynomials for m < n variables and all symmetric polynomials in n variables with degree < d .\n","#Knowledge-2#:These relations between the roots and the coefficients of a polynomial are called Vieta's formulas . The characteristic polynomial of a square matrix is an example of application of Vieta's formulas. The roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues of the matrix . When we substitute these eigenvalues into the elementary symmetric polynomials, we obtain – up to their sign – the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, which are invariants of the matrix. In particular, the trace (the sum of the elements of the diagonal) is the value of e 1 , and thus the sum of the eigenvalues.\n","#Knowledge-3#:Thus the determinant of a square matrix is the product of the eigenvalues.
